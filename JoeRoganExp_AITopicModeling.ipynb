got...my special comes out today, actually.Oh shit.Special comes out today actually.Oh shit.Special comes out.Terrified.What's it on?YouTube?That's the move.Yeah.Yeah.I'm very happy when guys do that.It makes it easily accessible.It's the best thing for like distributing your stuff.Yeah.People share it easy.It's nice that's a good option now because when everybody turns you down.It's a great option.It's a great option.It's a great option.I would think about it even if I had other options, because I think it's like the best distribution platform.As long as they don't fucking censor you, which is a little bit of an issue.You know, they're all owned by Google and it's just like whenever you deal with these GI and corporations and there's all these fucking woke kids working for them.It's a lot of sketchy things happen.But as far as a platform, it's the best.It's great, right?Oh, it's so good.I don't really like, I'm not like edgy like that, so I don't really have any, my edgy stuff is not that edgy.That's good.Yeah, that's lucky.Yeah, because like Ari Schaffer when out.I was learning for her.He's exactly a producer.Oh, he's exactly a producer.Or that's nice.I'm really tight.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Someone we were just talking about someone gave him shit for releasing his on YouTube.I'm like, you're so short-sided.That's so stupid.I'm looking at it now.Yeah.It's fucking huge.What does it have like seven million downloads or something like that?Yeah.Yeah.People, which, you know, look, you get an Netflix special, it's great.Like the Tom Brody roasts great.I'm happy Netflix is doing cool shit like that.It's awesome.But do you watch a throw three hours?No.I watch Tony Hinchcliffe set and Andrew Schultz set and that's it.See Nicky's?I heard Nicky's was awesome.That's what it's really nice to see.Nikki killed it.Yeah, she killed it.Yeah, she goes hard.Yeah, Tony, Tony, she kills [2:06] those roasts.Yeah, she's really good at roasts.She's strong.She's got strong delivery, you know, she's got.And even like she was shitting on Jeff Ross, I did see that part when she's apologizing too much.She's hit it.Which is so Nikki Grazer.She's so sweet.That Hingshqil form with the liver king.You look like the, I'm gonna fuck it up, but the liver king and the tiger king had a baby that looked like Martin Luther King.He got beat up by the body king.He got beat by the lion king.So she's like that, I don't even know.It was a ride.It was such a ride.By the time he finished it, it was just like by the time he, if he was one king shorter, I didn't think it would hit as well.But that king was the perfect.It was a monster.It was five kings, I think.It was a monster bit.And then the which is football for the coin price.That's great.[3:05] I fucking love a roast.I'd love a good roast joke.You know what's so funny?It's like there's, you know, the Jewish, it's like, you know where you're going with Jeff or you know, or Jewish or whatever, but it's like, you still, it's still like, I still find a new way to be like, you watch as if it's a coin price.You know what I mean?It's like, yeah.You can tell that joke a million ways.Right, yeah.But still, I'm still like, oh my god, that's such a good way to tell it.Yeah.It's just, I think people have relaxed more with comedy over the last year or so for whatever reason.It feels like it dipped a little bit that whole I feel like people are tired of it all.Maybe you have to just throw a coat.Oh, throw a coat.We do a lot of shows.So what it is?Actually I have.We got the COVID.No, my baby got me sick.That'll do it.Those little kids get sick a lot.I was like fighting for a while, and then a few days ago, [4:01] it just took a dive.Do you take vitamins?Every single day and I get mocked for it.You should knock him mocked.My dad growing up, he used to take, we had one cabinet in the kitchen, one where he opened it and it was basically a mini GNC.Not like GNC, but it was like just, and every day, my whole life, I'd watch him throw down like 30 pills and just swig it, you know.And, but me, I just, I feel like I have a weak immune system.I got a weak constitution.So, like I try to take like the, I take like the liposome all, it's all like I take a D, a B, a C.I was taking like a multi and then you start hearing, oh it doesn't absorb and you gotta take this one and that one.So I take all immunity stuff at a donation to elderberry.What the fuck else do I think?What do you think causes your weak immune system you don't thought about?Yeah, I think about it my whole entire life what do you think it is?These just genetic thing?I don't know because no one of my, also my family's like that.So that's what led me to be coming like a little bit of a germaphobe because you wanna call it germaphobe, but I just know that if I put myself in the way [5:07] of like if someone sneezes, if I put myself in that, sometimes I can get a common cold.How long does it take you to get rid of the common cold?Like a day.Yeah, but you're super, yeah, but you're like you eat elk and...Yeah, just, I've had a few that last a couple of days, but it's usually one day before I don't feel good.But I've only had a couple of those recently and I assume they were the new COVID.Oh, really?Yeah, I assume.And you got it right into the day.Yeah, I assume this last one I got was the new COVID.This last one I got I didn't even do the IV vitamins.I was just too busy to sit down and just.What are they calling?New code like new code.There's so many strains dude.Yeah, I think we we We did a thing where they were trying to we were reading about it online where they were trying to document all the strains and how many were they up to Jamie?It's a crazy number.There's a lot of strings.I thought there was like four strings.There's no no no no.There's dozens [6:02] Yeah, they keep coming around new ones come around, new variants come around.What they're saying is this is just how we're gonna be forever.That stuff's just out there in the wild now.Those little gremlins.So that doesn't bow well for me, but I...Common call one, two weeks, men.Really?Yeah, I've had a cold like five, six weeks, many times.Wow.Lingering, not like you know, do you ever do IV vitamins?I've only done it twice in my life.It's so funny.I shot the special in December in Chicago.And the day of I woke up and I had a cold.Just because I was just running myself into the ground, right?So I woke up.My throat was like, it was hurting me, it was scratchy, my voice was raspy and I had no energy, I'm like, oh, freaking the fuck out, right?So I get to the theater and I'm telling them, like, I don't know what to do, like I feel so weak, I gotta do something.So Ari's feeding me these, all day long, he's feeding me these Baroko tablets, they're like these vitamin dissolving tablets that are...Right, he's into those.Yeah, they're like a hundred, you know, billion percent, whatever, right?[7:06] So he's feeding me those and then I get to the place and they get me the IV and the guy gives me a B12 shot.And then I had just started Vivance.What's that?It's for ADHD.So it's like an antaroll almost.Oh no.And I had just started a few days earlier.So I'm like, not really, it hasn't really like, I'm not really regulated to it yet.And I just didn't realize that his tablets are he would give me.I looked back afterwards and they were like cat, they all had caffeine.And then I got this B12 shot 20 minutes before I, the first show.And I was on the viven Vivance which was Adderall and it was the highest dose.I didn't realize that this was all happening to me and like three minutes of where I went out.I was the most wired.I ever was in my entire life of 40.Like I just was I was like literally and then I had the adrenaline just because it was the first taping.You know what I mean?Oh my god.[8:01] I just feel like I'm getting struck out.I was holding my hand that it was doing this Oh, I'm like, oh, he's crazy.Give me three of these fucking things today every one of them has 200 milligrams of caffeine Oh my god, I didn't give you three.I'm like you gave me three You didn't give me you get how do you look me in the face?I you were both there I was like it I'm tough for here in the second hand and then the beat I think the B12 shot just put it over the top.Oh my God.And it was like, it's a combination.It's time for his band.I didn't use one second from show one.Oh my God.So one second.The, is it like a Adderall or is it like a Adderall?It's Adderall.It's basically Adderall.Yeah, it's like same exact thing.And why did you think you needed that?Why do you think you needed that at all?I mean, I suffer from ADHD and little OCD for like my whole life.And it got...So what does that mean?Like when you say ADHD, how does it manifest itself in your life?So many ways.Mainly the thing that affects my life as I can't focus.[9:01] I can't focus on something for, especially if I'm like, this up in down days, but I can't focus on something for more than like, if I'm trying to complete something, I won't complete it.Like what kind of stuff?Like if I'm writing or if I have just stuff to do, anything at all, paying bills is that, anything that where I have to use my mind.Like, I'll be, I'll plant my ass down and I'll be trying to like write a send an email whatever my leg is shaking like crazy because I, I don't want to sit there.I just like, and I just, it's helped because I can multitask like 500 things at once, but it also hurts because I, it's really hard to get something done.I can't remember anything, so I only, I have like 50 lists in my phone.They're all labeled and prioritized that helps me But I have to use that although I won't remember anything Right I can't have trouble reading Like I'll read a page and then I will like I have no idea it was on that page I have to read the page again.So I ended up reading really slow.Is it with everything you read or is only some stuff?[10:03] It's anything that you read where that's not a problem?Books are tough, like long form reading.Like fiction or nonfiction.Just like just a lot of pages in between two covers.The genre doesn't play into the fact.So not even like a really like there's not one book that just captivated you and you like easily can read it.Yeah, I mean, like I said, this good and bad days.So if I'm reading a biography, I don't really read fiction.Oh, okay.Yeah, but I like biographies, really.If something like that, but honestly, it's really tough.I really don't read as much as, you have any books I've bought.I have a lot of books, but I just, so many aren't bought.I have a lot of books, but I just, so many are in open.I have one day I'm gonna read that.Do I have this guilt that I had?I think about that.I'm, when I, I know I'm not gonna do it.I'm like, I always to myself to read all these books.And I just keep picturing myself like on my deathbed.To be like the books.I can't.You know, it's wasted money.It is.But it's also, it's nice to have books in your house.[11:06] It is.I have this weird theory about books that I haven't read that are cool.It's like at least they're near me.Only some getting the energy off of that book, that really good book.Like whoever wrote it, whatever it is.Yeah, I can see that.I know that book's awesome.Yeah.I can't even listen to audio.You think audiobooks would be the solve?It doesn't matter.No, I can't listen to someone unless it's really, really good about it.It's hard to listen to someone drawn on, you know?It's hard, but a lot of them are really good at it.There's some really good voice over actor guys.Yeah.And including they do fiction, so they do a bunch of different voices.It's a real art form now.It's almost like old-timey radio stories or something Yeah, that I love I mean I love it.My buddy on on a I do a show with He has a bunch of books out published and One of the things we when does this come out?He's gonna So we do a lot of keep a lot of secrets from each other right and then surprise each on on the show, the show, if you don't know people I know, [12:05] it's just called the impractical joke.It's me and my buddies of 35 years.Fucking huge show dude.It's gigantic.It's crazy, congratulations.Thank you so much, thank you man.I remember when guys were talking about it in the parking lot of the store, when it was just blowing up.And people were talking about You guys are doing shows and they were just mobbed and everybody's like that show is huge.Yeah, it was wow.Not expected or anything.It was on true TV, you know?Yeah, which is like a not a network where people really blow up from.Right?There's a few though, but it just shows you if something's fun, people find it.Yeah, well there was nothing like it.They only did, they had no joke.They had two different porn shows.This is what we got on.They had two different porn shows.Three, three different towing shows.And two storage shows.And then they showed like the stupidest criminals of all time.And that was it.So we were the first comedy.[13:00] So I guess it kind of resonated on the channel because we were like alone in that manner.I heard a lot of those storage shows are for Gaze.So much of all the reality stuff is come.Oh, so a lot of it is.I mean, I'd say 95%.There's a lot of finagling going on behind the scenes with the truth just for narratives.If you pause the credits, like there's always like that fine print in the credits.Oh yeah.If you have to say that.They're allowed to like, they use it to create a theatrical piece that's not necessarily representative of what actually happened.I mean, brother, they've been looking for bigfoot for nine to use now.Well, no, it's worth that, right?How many to eat?How many to eat?Go finding bigfoot versions of the show that are like refinding them or research.Refinding him.Refinding him again.So many.So many fucking dorks in the woods.Looking for nothing.Even ghosts.It's like, I mean, people, I'm more interested in ghosts than I am Bigfoot.Me too.Because the thing about Bigfoot is, like, [14:01] I think it was probably a real animal.And I think there's some ancient stories that are passed down for thousands of years Sure, I think I think that's probably what it was but ghosts are weird because they're in every culture Right and I haven't experienced a ghost, but imagine if I did trying to explain it to someone I'm not sound like a fucking maniac like it's just a crazy person.Oh, I saw ghost.Let me try Okay, you see one didn't see one, but here's the thing.I don't believe in ghosts.Okay, but then I had this happen to me and now I don't really know what to like to what to feel.Q the spooky music.And his spooky music over there, Jamie.My family believes in ghosts.They're like they're all for it.My sister had a thing.She was she lived at home and she came home one day and she opened the door to her room and every single one of her closet drawers were open.Every single thing that could be opened in the room was open and it freaked her out a little bit and she asked if anyone did it and it was just my stepma my dad, they said no and she was like felt uncomfortable about that [15:01] and then she closed everything and then whatever, she used to lock it after that.And then one day, like months later, she had locked it, she gave it, she opened it, they were all open again.I tell her, I don't even believe, like I don't know what, she's not lying to me, but I don't know what to make of it, but I don't think it's a ghost.But my grandpa, That That's like the Hulk.That's not about to get in my socks.Yeah, that was like, wait for the candles to be lit.But my grandfather died in the house, but like, oh, yeah.But this is not, that's not what I was saying.One night I was home.There we go.It was foggy out.No, it's me.So I just live alone and I'm just I live alone and I'm just I'm in bed and I'm you know I'm laying in bed at my television is on and I I do lock even when I live alone I lock my bedroom door when I go to sleep I lock my bathroom door when I'm taking a shower I always have [16:00] right so my door is locked and I'm laying there and I'm watching TV and I sleep at a CPAP, right?So what's good about that is like, I can go all the way under the covers like a cocoon and I still have a form of debris.So I like wrap myself like a fucking burrito for real.It's so delightful.I'm like, the CPAP, yeah.He breathes in his scuba diving.This is the whole way you're scuba diving.You're sleeping.That's so crazy.So I love it.So I wrap myself over my head and everything.And what I really do, like what's really fun when you're in there is to just poke out a foot or just or a hand.That's really fun.And just get like a cool breeze and then wonder about what's under the bed's gonna bite your feet Sure a little bit it depends on the night, right?But like you know, I was a Sounder dangly I don't like haunts.I will tell you that I don't believe it goes But like haunted houses and scares we can get into that later.Wait a minute.What's the difference?What are they haunted by well like you know like fake ones even I'm saying.Oh, I don't even like I don't even like the [17:06] Like fake ones even I'm saying.I don't even like I don't even like the go through.Okay.No, I don't like that shit But it's not that's funny because the guy likes to play jokes on people Yeah, yeah, I mean well, I do I really play jokes.I don't know if I would I do really it's like Yeah, it's like the four of us.It's fun.Yeah, they're thick.It's crazy shit.We did but um you know Like about good haunted house?Like, ah, they jump out of nowhere and scare the fuck out of you.I'll tell you how much I don't like that.We went on the show, they know I don't like it.So they created one time they put me in a cornfield and they made it haunted and I had to navigate it.And then the next time they upped it and they got an old mansion and they completely built it all out and made it haunted and I just put me in there locked the door and made me alone in the mansion.And it's, did you want to really see like a collection of shit that will freak you out?Go to Zach Begins thing in Vegas.Oh, is that that like thing where they get really weird with you?He's got this like a zavisceral thing like they put a gun in your throat and stuff like [18:02] that.No, no, no, no, no.He's got this crazy mansion in Vegas.That's like a museum of haunted shit, a museum of like like they have Dr.Kovorkian, the van where he killed people.They have the van.Yeah.They have a bunch of stuff that Ted Bundy owned and a bunch of stuff that Ed Gain owned.Yeah, it's a creepy fucking play.This is the one I had the thing on my...This is the...Stupid.Holy crap.Oh, holy crap.Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I Yeah, I See now I know I had to threaten that girl because I know look I here's a deal I should have ghost I know she's not even Not crazy I just mean I just don't like be the jump scares.I don't like it Like in the cornfield they've had a little girl right and I was 20 minutes into this cornfield [19:03] Where's this little label?Oh, it's lost here?This girl just stand there waiting for me.She's in like a dress.She's a little girl, pigtails and I see her in the distance and I go is that a little girl and then she just raised her hand and pointed at me and I had to follow this path that they laid out and it went past it had to go past the girl.Right.I don't know how to explain it, man.I know that they did this to me, right?But yeah, I was like, I know you're a little girl, but I will fucking punch you.I told him.I think when I went past, I'm like, I know you're a girl.I was like, look, I know I can beat you up.Don't jump scare me because I'm liable to punch you.I'm letting you know right now.That was the look, But, wait, it's all double back on this one.Corn is fucking scary to get lost in.Corn maize?Yeah.It's terrible.It's really weird.There's a place in California where they have a farm and they have a corn maize.You can walk around this maze, it's fun.Because you know you can eventually get out.Go in and lie.You get lost in this maze.[20:02] You get really lost and it's kind of confusing.And now imagine this is thousands of acres.Right?And you're in the center of it with no water.And you have no eye.You might be walking around in circles.You really have no idea.You may as well be on like the mountains when people die.Yeah, people die in cornfields, man.That's a real thing.I mean, I feel was ever in that situation, I'd just go straight and not stop.I wonder how many people over in history have died in cornfields.Just heat exhaustion.11.Get law 11.Yeah, that's what you think.We had looked it up.For real?No.Let's guess.Let's say you guess.I want to guess, but then I, I think 11's a solid number.I think 11's are a good guess.Like 11 people over the course of America of dieting corn fields.No, back in the day.A lot.Think about that.But they didn't have monocrop agriculture back then.I don't even know what that is.That's like these giant corn fields.Where like in this country right now, look this up I think it's true.I think 5% of the land mass of the United States [21:07] is being used for corn fields.That's still, that's crazy.That's crazy.That's crazy.That's so crazy.I think that's correct.The guy on my show that I was...By the way, I just read the headline of that.I'll be real clear.Yeah.I didn't even read the whole article.I just read the headline of that I'll be real clear yeah I didn't even read the whole article I just read that okay well this guy he just might not be good he put a cornfield in his yard is five acres he built the cornfield register as a farm so you get tax breaks yes this sell fifty thousand dollars worth of corn in order to get it so how to do that right now how much corn is fifty thousand dollars worth of corn no clue it's it feels like a lot to me.Isn't it a lot to me?Because if you've seen government subsidizes corn, as well.Well, you know where it all came from?Came from World War II.So during the war, people need food.And they wanted to make sure that in the future, they would have stockpiles of food.You know, the war just ended, but who knows what's gonna happen now with Russia?We can be into it again, let's prepare.[22:05] And they started subsidizing corn production.Then they just started using corn for all kinds of extra stuff.That you're not supposed to use it for like oil.Yeah.Or corn syrup.That's those fucking.I can't find the percentage which I'm trying to get to, but I've got 97 million acres, which is about the same size as California.What?Wow.Oh, there's no shortage of that, then.There's so much, court.Okay, so like, what percentage of that is California's got to be more than 5% of the country, right?No, it's tough because they're not counting Alaska.Right, Alaska's so big.The Alaska is way bigger than Texas and Texas is enormous.I think Alaska is like three Texases.Really?I think that percentage of that coin you think we're consuming and what's going to waste.I don't know if it's a waste thing.It just goes because you can use it for so many different things.[23:00] You can use it to make alcohol.You can use it to make corn syrup.You can use it to make oil You know, I think they're just it's like a money racket It's like the corner of this market and people were better off when they were using actual sugar and people were better off when they weren't eating corn syrup and fucking everything.It's just not good for you and then you know What people think is corn or canola oil, that's not canola oil, that's rapeseed oil.That's an industrial lubricant that they figured out a way to refine down to the point where human beings can eat it not die immediately.People fucking put it on everything.This is the first time, like I really, like in the last like 10, whatever, when I was a kid we didn't eat I mean like my parents like I got I love them but like we didn't eat fresh Vegetables we got canned everything.This is about a third of America's corn crop is used for feeding cattle hogs and poultry in the US Corn provides the carbs in animal feed while soy beans provide the protein takes a couple bushels of American corn to make [24:05] Corn fed steak by some estimates a beef cow can eat a ton of corn if raised in a feedlot.Biltary cows and beef cows also consume silage, which is fermented corn stalks and other green plants.So a third of the corn crop is used to make ethanol, which serves as renewable fuel, additive gasoline.The rest of the corn crop is used for human food, beverages and industrial uses in the US or export to other countries for food or feed use.Used to make breakfast cereal, tortilla chips, grits, canned beer, soda, cooking oil, biodegradable packing materials.Have you ever watched that documentary King Corn?No.It's great.It's a good one to watch.It's a giant industry that's not good for us.That's like all the things that it does.Like you can do with other things and you'll be better.Right, right, right.This is it's captive.It'll never change.Also corn on the cob is fucking delicious.[25:00] That's the best corn.That's the best former corn.It's nothing wrong with corn.I love corn on the corn.It's great.I like Why is it so much cream?Cream of corn soup is I haven't had that oh I Maybe I have that three-tonk cream corn veer of cream.Yeah, I got a steak house.Yeah, that's it.Corn's great Don't get wrong, but on the cob.It's like it's the best the sweet corn that sweet corn with butter But Butter.When you take the butter and the butter, like, takes on the shape of the corn comp, because you just reckless, you run in a hole, stick a butter around that.You fill the whole, that's how I do it.Oh yeah.You hold the corn, you hold the stick and go like this.Oh yeah.Oh, fucking sweet corn, fresh off the grill with butter.Oh, well the best, so delicious.Three, four of those things.So delicious.I don't know why they're better.And you take that same exact corn and you like kind of put it, just take it off.It's good, but it's just better on the cob.It's also you're getting a melted butter in all the minerals and it's in your mouth while you're biting into it.Oh yeah.You know what else they use corncubs for and the 1800s?Pipes!Well, four toilet paper.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop-up.Pop- abundant.God, it's soft and easy to handle.Oh, boorah![26:26] Look at the sailors use something they call a toe rag.By the way, back then they didn't even run in water.So it's not like they're washing these things off.You're a sailor with a corn cob.You're going to use that corn cob over and over again.You're going to be smearing new shit over the area, over the old shit dried up.It dangled in the water to clean it off.Oh, yeah.A bit of a dangle.I'm gonna fix it up, lad.Hi.You ever think about like how we got, like how people would have sex back there?Like how would people still fuck back there?They were disgusting things.Think about how many years, it's only like the last hundred years that people are disgusted.Yeah, we were talking about St.Agnes who went his whole life.Was it St.Agnes?Yeah, I mean, back to it.[27:06] Anyway, take his whole life without having a bath.How did his whole life...He copped to that?If there was once a year or so long.No, no, it wasn't even that.It was like you were supposed to do that.Oh, yeah, like bathing, it starts to be a problem.I don't know what happens.I wonder what happens.Like what just happens if you never bathed?Like we just assume that you have to bathed.Maybe that's the source of a lot of our problems.We're not like covered in dirt and bacteria all the time.Like we're supposed to be like a normal animal.Maybe that war did rafting.Maybe that war did're acting.Maybe that warded off like I bet it.No, didn't did that.No, you don't think a T-Rex would be like, I don't know how we made it so far.I really don't.I really don't.I don't understand it.I mean, I know is the invention of weapons and tools and stuff and building houses, but God damn, we're so weak.Like how much different were we back then?[28:05] We are so fucking weak.I just can't imagine us without the houses and the weapons.Like how did we even make it that far?And how much of a change was it?Once we developed the houses and the weapons because we are so bitch-ass, like as an animal.Even if you're fit and in shape, even if you're a UFC fighter, you're like Islam Akachev.To compare to the nature world, our animal species is so bitch ass.Right, right.We're so bitch ass.It's insane that we made it this far.Yeah, it is, I guess just.Like just the fact that we even survived to the point where we made a bow and arrow.Like how?Not everything, not just run up on us and eat us.I don't know.And it's like the day, I always think about this too.The first, there's always the first time, first person.There was one person who was like, oh shit, hold on a second.[29:00] I guess.And now, I guess they probably stepped on things and cut themselves with it and then realize they could pick those things up and cut other things with it and then they figured out how to make those things.Yeah.And then we got email.Then we got email.Fast forward.Fast forward you got AI.Yeah.Fast forward.Yeah, I mean, could you fucking imagine being born, you know, in in Africa 500,000 years ago.If you put me in Africa now, if you put me in the forest right now.In the Congo, right?If you put me anywhere right now, I'm done.I don't know how to make a fire.I don't really, I don't know how to, I don't know anything, I can't explain anything.I can't explain to you how mirrors work.Cause some places like I was reading this thing.No, it was actually Paul Rosalie.Paul Rosalie was talking about this.They're like, if you get caught in the Amazon, do not try to make a fire because you won't be able to and it'll break your spirit.Like you're not gonna be able If you're lost in the Amazon, forget a fire.[30:05] It's not going to happen.You're broken spirit will kill you before the balance.You will realize how hopeless your plight is when it's impossible for you to make a fire.So now you're going to realize that everything that you eat is going to be raw.And you're going to have to catch things and eat them raw to stay alive.And now you're an animal.No.I don't even know.I'd be on the, I'd be on the, trying to catch a small animal and strangle it.And the likelihood of them finding you is so small.If you just go on a walk about, if you're like some wacky dude who goes off his meds and decides to go on a walk about in the Amazon, they're not going to find you.So many walkabouts just don't turn out well.A lot of them don't.Why why keep walking about it?Well why are walkabouts so romantic to us?You know like that movie with a kid who what was the movie called?Were you lived in the bus in Alaska?Yeah.Into the wild?[31:01] Oh yeah yeah.Into the wild like why is that so romantic to us?For someone who just goes out into the wild and even if the dude dies out there, that guy did.Maybe there's some type of like, whether it be just finding yourself or like just being at one with these elements as much as possible feels like something romantic I guess.Yeah.It feels like this understanding that we're disconnected from the rest of the world.It puts perspective for sure.It does give perspective.It's also like the more disconnected we are, the more ridiculous we behave.Like, where do people behave the most ridiculously in big cities?The most disconnected from nature, the most.You're living in concrete jungles, Hong Kong, F**k you most you're living in concrete jungles Hong Kong fuck you you live in New York City like you're disconnected from nature period fuck your park parks cute yeah park you it's surrounded by New York City like that is it's so unnatural it's so contained yeah it's actually contained by the city the park is contained yes it's not peaceful it's peaceful enough [32:02] right it's a nice park it's a lovely park but you've been through it all.You've been through it all?Yeah, I've been through the park.I mean, but lovely.Because it's like I thought I went to it, but then one day I like really went to it.It's like I went to like every area, which is there's so many things I didn't know.It's like really big.There's beautiful thing about New York City that they have that park in the center of it.It really changes the dynamic of the city.It does.I think it makes the city a more livable place, a more friendly place.Absolutely.I mean, it's crazy that you have this insane urban environment then inside of this massive park.It's like another world in there.It is.It is.But the difference between that and the woods, the actual woods, like the Colorado Rockies.The difference being out there in the, waking up and just looking and all you see in front of you is mountain peak after mountain peak after mountain peak and it just going along.That is a different feeling.That's the real feeling and that feeling is, I think that feeling is like [33:02] a thing we're supposed to get.I think that's supposed to be a part of our requirements of being a human being that we connect with the Earth.That the Earth sees us, we see it, we're out there in it, and we realize our actual place.We get all cocky in our fucking Uber, in New York City, getting out, buying a slice, and you think you're all disconnected.We think we're better than them.But we just trapped in our own little fucking zoo, the little zoo that we've created.But when you go out in the world, you feel so vulnerable.You go out into the woods.You feel so, so minuscule and but connected.Connected.But you're right.You start to feel where our place is.We are not as we are, bitch.S.Yeah.Yes.That's right.That's a bitch.That first wave that comes over you is a bitch.S wave.Bitch.Right.Compared to all the other things, bitch.I don't think I'm catching anything.I don't think I'm going to kill any.I, I, what but you know you ain't getting out of it.So it's like your survival mode is gonna kick in.[34:06] How long you last, I don't know.You probably go into shock.Right.Like, bear grabs it, you probably just go into shock.Well, I had this conversation yesterday actually.So would you be able to play dead?It depends on what the bear wants, man.See, there's two types of bears.Black bears and brown bears.Black bears or more like this is two types of bears in North America.Yeah.There's the black bears.They're also brown too.A lot of black bears are very, even blonde.They look blonde.Sometimes they're called color phase bears.But they're more like black bears are more likely to try to eat you.Oh, I thought they are more likely.No, they're more likely to try to bite you and kill you to eat you.Whereas brown bears for the most part when they're killing people.Grizzly?Yes.Brown bears are the big ones are the ones that are the coastal bears because they have access to all the seafood.That's why those are like those Kodiak bears.Enormous.Enormous.Grizzly bears.But there's the same bears, the same species.It's just you have the inland one, which is eating mostly animals and berries and shit like that.[35:06] And they have the coastal ones just gorging in salmon.And so they're fucking huge.They put me in a cage with two of them.They're actually less likely to try to go after you because they have an abundant food source.Like there's people that camp out by the river and watch these enormous fucking bears just eat salmon.But the bears don't want to have nothing to do with you.They're just eating salmon.Like the Revenant, right?I don't care what kind of bear it is.It doesn't bear coming at you.The bear has bad intentions, black, brown, white.And they tell you to lay down and just stay there.Like I know that like the bear's gonna catch you if you keep running, but you could, you think that you could play dead in that moment?No.It doesn't matter.It'll just start eating you.Right, so why did the thing get this advice?Because if it's a mama bear, so if a mama bear goes after you because her cubs are there, if you stomp and you scare her, like if you come too close and she doesn't know you're there, she thinks you're a predator she may charge you she charges you and bites you and you you should [36:06] play dead you should play dead with her because she's not trying to eat you she's just trying to protect her cuff okay she wants an eye but it doesn't mean she won't eat you either yeah how do you don't you want to eat dead when she's sometimes through this sometimes she just wants to eliminate the threat and then get her baby's the safety.Yeah.So that's why playing dead works with mama bears sometimes.So you just hope it won't run mama.But it's a big sometimes.It's a big sometimes because sometimes they just eat you.Like they're bears.We don't have like a fucking like treaty with them.Right.That's why my strategy is just not to put my job in a place where there are bears.That's a good move.You know?And it'll help you.That'll help you a lot in this life.Yeah.If you want to avoid getting by bears, don't go across one like that, like in just in the wild.The scariest thing I came across, I've talked about it too many times in the podcast, but to tell you, I saw a big mountain line from about 30 yards away.But I was inside my friend's truck and he spotted it.It was about [37:05] doska was in Utah in the mountains and we were taking this corner and he hits the brakes.He goes look at that cat and we look in about 30 yards away under a tree is this enormous, enormous mountain line with like a head like a pumpkin dude and these giant forearms and it's just sitting there We're like holy fuck man, and I had binoculars so I pick up the bino so I have these 10 power binoculars I'm looking in its face.Oh shit.Oh shit.And I'm but I'm protected.I mean so the car we have a gun I'm protected and I'm did you still shitting my pants?That's crazy.I felt like it like it Shitting my pants like I felt like it like it some primal fear yeah some primal recognition of an actual monster Yeah, yeah that that kicked in from the inside that I mean that's from inside yeah truck with a gun Doesn't matter when the bad doc.Yeah, yeah, you look at the shit and it's eyes are kind of because it's dusk [38:02] The eyes are kind of glowing a little bit.Yeah Yeah, yeah, no, no, thank you.That's dusk the eyes are kind of glowing a little bit.Yeah.Yeah, yeah, no thank you.No thank you.That's those are the real monsters.And I had a collie dog bite me once and I was that scared.So it's like I'm not going to.If your cat wants to fuck you up, that's a real problem.Yeah, I don't do cats.But imagine a cat that's 170 pounds.Yeah.Dude, it's so scary.This is so big.You ever see these guys on Instagram, like they live with lions?Oh, those guys are going to go crazy.On the couch and they're like, come over and they just feed them like a sandwich.You know, Melanie Griffith grew up with lions.No, but the whole house was filled with lions.Yeah.How does that, there's not something everybody everybody knows a house was free ride free Romance no no no they had pet lions.I mean enormous pet lions.What did she all these photographs of her as a child in California?This right wasn't where her wish but what was her family was cookie just this was your these would just cookie lion pets [39:02] Yes, it wasn't like they were like car nieces No, don't crazy lion people and they did a movie with these lions and the movies supposed to be like the dumbest movie of all time Illegal it was illegal to do this is the movie.What's it called again?What is it Jamie?Roar roar, so these are all their lines and a bunch of people got fucked up in the making of this movie too, but no shit I don't believe it because they used to actual real lions man and so like if we fucking sees Melanie Griffiths is in this stupid movie all these clips are these actors on right now yeah, they're acting with their pets.Those are real lions.Everyone I knew everyone of those people were yes.How was that?What was the insurance for that?insurance and shmarrants.You know, they're fucked up here with your insurance.Yes!How was that?What was the insurance for that?The insurance in Lawrence.You know, in the fuck guy here with your insurance.They locked me in a motel room with a tiger, a bangle tiger, and then Joker's movie.They pushed me into a roadside hotel room, closed the door behind me.I turned around, there was no knob on the inside, and I just was like, what is this for?[40:01] And I heard a grumbling.Oh my God.And then literally I was like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, which is what are you talking about?It's chained to the pole in the shower.Bro, I also want you to look at that bitch as chain.I thought you would say look at that bitch as in the corner.Look at that chain.You don't think you can break that chain?I know he could.I was saying it.That is so crazy.Yeah.That's such a crazy thing to do.I just forgot about that until this it too.Fuck those things man.I said to them, oh fuck those things.This isn't funny, it's not gonna be funny so I had to make the movie.Like the first thing I said on camera is, do we have insurance in the movie?I couldn't even like play it up and I just stayed in the fucking movie.Dude, yeah.Fuck that.But Roy, Roy, look at that guy, that's a secret in Roy Same thing like he he raised that right tiger from the time it was a baby and he would tell you know why it had [41:06] There's all the speculation It was a lady with like some crazy hat on apparently and they think that like maybe the tiger was agitated by the late But it's all just get the got the tiger just decided to bite him Yeah, if that's all it takes is that tiger to get agitated by a lady Yeah, I mean you're playing with you're rushing to light your whole life.I mean, like, he would tell you a billion times over.I'd say, if it's safe, and then he gets his throat cut out.I don't think he'd tried to kill him though.I think it was carrying in a way like a cub.Yeah, I think his limp body, did they show that?Yeah, I don't think they showed it, but I think they have it.I don't think anybody no, he was paralyzed Yeah, but he kept the tiger right he was like I figured I'm I'm so ladies fall You can't trust those things I was just kid because when it goes he saw the one where the guy was He had a train grizzly bear for a movie it'd been in a few movies [42:02] Yeah, and it just he's doing this thing with you.And it just bites his guy's neck off.Just jumps on this guy's neck and tears it apart in front of everybody and there's nothing anyone could do about it.The bear just jumps on him for no reason.Dude, it's just standing there.Just totally standing still.And the bear just decides, I wanna bite you.Imagine what you feel in that moment knowing that no, no, no, you're going to die knowing that it's gonna be this way Knowing that people are watching and can't help and you're gonna die in front of like your whole life When am I going how's it gonna happen?It could have all been avoided like don't do that don't get out there This is just not it's not a hundred percent kids even if it's 99.9 percent that that little tiny one that when the bear decides To just do what nature wants it to do.Yeah.They want to kill things, man.It's part of the fun of being a bear.It's part of the fun of being a tiger.It's part of the fun.They like to kill things.That's how they survive.There's a reward system that's built into their DNA and we have this stupid belief that [43:01] we could just slide stakes under the door and they'll be cool with that.Yeah, and then eventually they just want I want to get my own meat.Yeah, like you're not the boss of me.So the tiger never attacked him during the Vegas show he saved my life I don't know Roy.I don't know if we're picking it up.Why does he think the tiger saved his life?Instinctively, oh, he said he might have been having a stroke.Hold on a second.Roy maintains that Monacoir was really trying to drag him to safety after seeing him felled by what he thinks may have been a stroke.He said he instinctively saw that I needed help and he helped me.Oh, he was taking medication for high blood pressure for years.Said he recently began to suffer dizzy spells, and this one spell unfortunately occurred in the presence of a very large tiger.He said, I started feeling weak.He still speaks slowly, but has recovered most of his German accent in speech.As I fell over, Montecor saw that I was falling down, so he actually took me and brought me to the other exit where everybody could get me and help me.[44:05] He knew better than I did where to go.So he's saying that the tiger fucked him up accidentally while it was dragging him to safety.That come out right away.I don't know, that's, I mean, that's, I mean.That's amazing if that's what happened, but they don't, tigers don't understand.You can't just drag a dude by his neck and not like break it.Yeah.Because we're bitch ass.He's like Lenny from Advising Man.Yeah, so you could do that to a puppy.Two gaping puncture wounds to the neck.Before passing out, it recalls that leave Montecore alone, bring him back to brother and sister, let him be happy.These guys are so great.I picture Roy Dupren from severe blood loss.This picture of like just blood sports.He's like, thank you.Thank you.Thank you.Leave him alone.Just bring him back to his brother and sister.Oh my God.Suffering from severe blood loss and shock, he was considered medically dead at one point when his heart stopped.He also suffered the stroke that would ravage the left side of his body.So was the stroke before or was the stroke [45:01] because of him getting bitten?I mean, if it was, it might be rationalizing.Yeah, yeah.He could have just had the stroke, and that would be bad enough, but he could have just had a stroke.Do they know when he had the stroke?No, man.I don't see it.What are you saying makes sense though, if that cat loves him and the cat sees him faint and the cat wants to drag him to safety.Yeah.Just they don't know they can't deal with bite you.You see the reunions with these, the reunions of like the trainers and they haven't seen many years like these like zoo guys.Oh yeah.That raise like tigers and set them free and then they reunite them.Oh.Like in the wild they reunite them and these tigers just come charging out the guy jump up and just thought licking them.Oh.Yeah.You see that and I think that's bad press to put out there really.I tell you the truth.Why?Because it's making them, it looked like a domesticated house cat.The thing that looks adorable, it's licking it.I'm like, maybe I can raise a lion.Yeah, I don't do that.Yeah, that's a good point.realizes like oh my god that life is so much better than this bullshit life at chasing gazelles [46:05] I know right, you know, like these guys are in this guy's like leather sectional in his house And he's feeding them.He's just throwing the meat.He's like playing You know like I'm like hot this guy's going to die.He has like 30 lions free roaming the house Yeah, he's got like a billion you Instagram followers I had to, everyone's following waiting for the post.Tiger scene in Houston neighborhood found after a week of searching and legal wrangly, a week.A week is crazy.Oh, wait, that's so crazy.You have a tiger rolling around for a week.Just dodging for a week.How is it hiding?Yeah, like how are they so bad at finding time?Anyone who lays eyes and not tiger is calling it in.Yeah, but don't you have helicopters and shent?Like, yeah, you don't let that go for a week.How do you get that?How's it?Where's it going?Where'd it go?Nobody gets lunch until they find it.It's like, you can't just let it go.Yeah, it's overtime, boys.Come on.Every night.bit tomorrow.We'll wake up early.It's not a tiny tiger.So it came right up to people.Is that what it's doing?It says it's an off to the police officer points a weapon [47:08] as the apparent owner retrieves the tiger that had gotten out.Oh my God.So this dude can just grab it.That's kind of cool though that they just let the guy grab his tiger instead of shooting it.Until they find like a bunch of dead dogs and cats.You think that that's a small tiger?I went to the Nashville Zoo, I got like a back stage, whatever, tour whatever.They had baby cloud leopards.That would just burn.I held them in my hand and fed them with a bottle, right?They were this big.I mean, you could have crushed it, right?And a year later, I was back there on the road, I went back and they said, do you wanna see the baby cloud leopard, you fed?And they build these outdoor structures, these cages.So they're living outside, but they're in outdoor cages.So they bring me in the cage, right?And we're with a few people, and they're like, that's the one that you fed last year.And it's like, now it's like, it was this big, when I fed them now it lean, like this big.Like bigger than any house cat you've ever seen, but like not like, you'd still think like, [48:07] you know, it couldn't hurt you as they tell you, whatever you say, whatever you do, just don't turn it back to it.So I was like, okay.And I was like, can this thing hurt me or not?Like why are we in here, you know what I mean?And at one point walk out turn around.It's swiped at me right here.I still have a mark for it.It swiped at me right here and sliced me in a droop blood.It wasn't a deep cut or anything.It just, like, missed it.It only did it when you turned your back.It's when I turned.I was like, oh my, it fucking did it.And it's just one line right here I fed you was yeah, yeah, it's something that's not looking anything.It's not looking.It's gonna get it And that's scary Built into its hard drive Dude, what about that lady got a face ripped off by the chimp?Oh just reading about that.Oh my god [49:00] I did for some some picture.I think I think I don't do it.Yeah, don't do it Yeah, that's a terrible story man That's horrific and like I think they have like audio of something like where she's just like Just 911 audio.Oh God.Oh, I mean those those chimps they like dismembered like this member you like they she he ripped her entire face All yeah, they try to ruin you They try to bite your fingers off they go for your genitals Yeah, they bite your fingers off they go for your genitals yeah they take your feet off that's how you know they got a that's a odd handbook for them that's like let me tear his feet off first I don't know who triple you yeah and I'm even trying to kill you they're trying to cripple you is that what they do yeah they're smart cripple you and then what evil and smart they're trying to win you can't build more fingers bitch just cripple you walk away and?And then you go and smile at the trend.I went up here and I didn't know more fingers, bitch.Just cripple you and walk away and be like, now live like that.Yeah, they don't just want to hurt you.Like they don't have any morals.They're just these wild and intelligent things.Why do they have a break point then?Why do they want to be just kind of...I don't know why want to kill you.I think they want to fucking hurt you.[50:08] You know, they punish you.They have like one of the more horrible stories was this guy had a chimp that he raised for a while and then it got big and it became a bit of a problem and he had to give it to a rescue center and he would go back with his wife and they would visit the chimp.And one time he went back and he brought the chimp a cake because it was his birthday.And the other chimp were so angry that they didn't get cake.You gotta be fucking good.And someone fucked up and left one of the doors open.And the chimp's got out.They figured out a way to get out.They open the door, attack the guy and just tore him apart.Tore his hands off, tore his face off.The guy who raised, uh-huh.It wasn't him.It wasn't the champion raised that did that.It was the other chimps.So the other chimps were jealous that they didn't bring them that he didn't bring them.[51:02] They can be evil.They can be evil.Like they they they don't care., that he didn't bring them to break the brick cake for everybody.They're evil.They can be evil.Like they, they don't care.It's not like a proportionate response to something.No, I think that's a, you know, a little bit.So they're intelligent, but they're also like ruthless in this crazy way that is incomprehensible.Like the worst, worst possible characteristics, you could ever imagine happening in human beings are just common, just common with chimps, commonplace.Man, that's another thing, like explaining these deaths.Like, you know, like his family down the line, he's like, oh, he brought out angel food cake to a...He didn't even kill him, just torn apart.He brought an angel food cake to a he didn't even kill him It just tore him apart.He didn't kill him.No, he survived And then he's got a life after that or what is how much you know his face is gone his hands are gone Part different bodies all fucked up.They just tear you apart.They go for your chick for your dick I want to have a physical cake now the guy they're probably done [52:04] Maybe it's probably should have brought four cakes.Yeah, it's probably a cookie guy only now.Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't look a cake too dramatic if he even has the eyeballs.And it's not like, yeah.I had a chip, I saw a chip bite somebody.I went on his little, yeah.When I was little, we upstate, like what do they call it?Like George and stuff like that?Sure I know what it is.We go up there and we, like, or even the poke, like the cat skills.Beautiful.Yeah.So we would go up there and I remember we were at this like little, little resort or whatever and they had like entertainment and they had like a daily show and it happened every day and we were there for a few days.So I would go to the show every day was in this little like cabaret theater and This guy would come out a cowboy in all sequence outfit and he hosted the show was for kids and There was all different acts and he would bring them out So he brings out one of the acts he brings out they the stage becomes an a little ice sheet ice skating rink And the ice skater and guy'd say is maybe twice the size of this table It's just for them to do like little little twirls.And the guy comes out and he has a chimp dressed [53:07] as a cowboy in ice skates.And he's dressed as a cowboy in ice skates.And they start skating together and doing and he's holding the chimp and they're twirling and twirling and everything.And then the chimp loses control.Flies, he lets go of the chimpimp the chimp flies off the stage and the woman at a little cocktail table in the front He landed on her and bit her right here as he landed bitter right here and she I mean she was bleeding everywhere.She's so screaming And she's screaming and the guy didn't know what to do and he got got the chimp and they got back onto the ice and He like he was like, okay.And he took a chunk, you saw a chunk of flesh out.I was like eight.You know what I was like, I couldn't believe, and there was no one really there.There was like 15 people.The place was empty.It was like a weekday chimp ice skating show.No one wanted to see it.[54:01] It was like at lunch.And it was all dark in there.Like it was like at lunch and it was all dark in there like it was all moody and everything Oh my god, it was it was a real experience and this guy just was like all right That's that's gonna be the show for today and the next day they did the show with the champ The next day they did the show with the same girl No, no the woman was a patron patron.Yes.Okay.I don't know what happened But could you sue back then with the suing days?I mean, did you hear anything about it?I mean, I always ate.I kept my head to the streets, but nothing came over my desk.I mean, I had to imagine it was some time of a lawsuit.I can't believe though that like the chimp didn't get put down.Yeah, yeah.Well, maybe it did.Maybe it did.Wow.I don't know.It was wild though.They started to clamp down on that.They're trying to pass laws.I skate.I skate.I skate, or just regular.Can I regular once?Because like this lady in Connecticut just said, like it was legal what she was doing.I think they've changed those laws though.You shouldn't be able to have that.We can't wear shoes on a plane.Because one time, one time, one guy failed at doing something with his shoes.[55:06] Right.This lady gets her face ripped off to the skull.Still can have chimpanzees.Still climbing this, not a big deal.I don't know if you can anymore after her.Yeah, I think they changed.She was the woman that did it.I think, well, there was those two different stories that were bolt in the news around the same time.One of them was the guy that brought the birthday cake to the chimps, and the other one was this lady whose friend was visiting her.Just got the chimp tore apart her front.That was a bad time for chimps.Okay, under CT, is this Connecticut?It's illegal to import and possess all primates in the family, hominade, guerrillas, chimpanzees, binobos, and orangutans.Zuz that are accredited by the association of Zuz and aquariums or the zoological association of America are exempt from the ban.So they passed a ban after she got tore up.But that's just Connecticut.But there's places you could have them.I guarantee you could have them right here.[56:02] I guarantee.You see people with Crocs.People have crocs in their apartments.There's people in the fucking New York City.In New York City, there's a guy that had a tiger in his house.This is apartment in the Lake the Cops.So there's a very famous photo of the cops going up the fire escape and you're looking in the window, you see a fucking cat.I mean, a a big tiger dude.Yeah.It's just like this like bearing it's teeth.It's the nuttiest picture.Yeah.What is he supposed to do?Uh.Shoot it with a dart or something, right?I think you have the shoot it, shoot it.Yeah.I don't think a dart, you're not, I mean, I don't know what they did.I don't know how they did it.Well, good lord.Who's going cat in the apartment to shoot with a dart.Are you fucking sure you're gonna hit it?Yeah, I'm not going to hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.I'm not gonna hit it.would put a dart.He's still like dogs.Yeah.A dog?Yeah.[57:05] He should have a dog with a dart.I swear that Tiger just doesn't live there till it dies because who's extracting that thing?And then, Yeah.Well, what if it gets out?Yeah.The figures out that windows are like, you just go right through them.What about in the forest?It's a every day.Joe, it's every day.It's, it does, it's a, they don't have very many crocodiles.More than I would, more than I think should happen.I mean, people have their houses like blocked off so the crocs hanket in there.Yeah, it's outgators, mostly.Oh, outgators, yeah.There's a difference.Crocodiles are way more dangerous.They're way more aggressive.But did they cohabitate?They do in the Everglades, apparently now, not a lot, but they've had more than one sighting of Nile crocodiles in the Everglades.And there's some, some of the biologists have a speculation that there might be a breeding population.[58:01] Really?Because there's so many ass holes who just release things in the Everglades.I mean, you know the Python situation there, right?No.You haven't seen them at?No.No.No.No.The Everglades are infested with giant pythons that are all invasive.They're all pets or from research.Are you serious?Yeah.Yeah.So they're either from research place where people were working.There was some of them definitely got released there, but other ones are released just because there's people's pets.So asshole, some fucking dude is in the death metal.Has a python.It's like, you know, I can't feed you right now, but I'm gonna let you go and into your deathmire.I'm gonna hit top you back.Remember me.Yeah, that's the fucking monster loose in the swamps and it just they've decimated the swamp So the Everglades is missing like 90% of all of its mammals Everything they're eating algators now the pythons are eating algators.There's this crazy Photos can you I guess yeah, right?Well they died doing it because the alligator like worked its way partially out of the pythons body with its tail [59:05] It's like that's a lot fucked up photo because the alligator like worked its way partially out of the pythons body with its tail.It's like that's the most wild fucked up photo.They threw me in the swamps in the body in New Orleans with where alligator is where for the show.Jesus Christ.Yeah man.Why?You could die man.It's like real.You could die thing.I know.They dressed me as a bog.They killed his suit as like a bog monster and they put me in a swamp and I had to hide behind this thing.I mean, dude, the swamp swamp.Not like what I was, we took a fan boat.The water looked like chocolate milk.If you put your hand under those, sir.That's so dangerous.I know.If you put your hand under the water, this, this low, you couldn't see your hand, right?It's about 110 degrees that day.They put me in these gullies.I was nervous about germs anyway, so I actually literally wore a condom to go in there because I was free of stuff going on with my pee hole.Like no, no parasite.Oh, right.Yeah, yeah.I was just like, I don't know if it was gonna help, but I was like, why not?Right.You know, like wearing a mask.Yeah,, I just tried, you know, anything I can help me really, because I wasn't allowed to say no, [1:00:06] you can't say no to these things.That's the whole point of the show.When you lose, you can't say no to whatever's coming your way.So there was a fan boat tour that passed the route and they wanted me to come out during the fan boat tour so the guy could be like, fuck it with me.Not to scare the people to make me look like a moron and just, yeah, but didn't know for sure.Okay, this is fine.Nope.So they didn't, I told me that that was happening.But, so that's why I find this attacking me.But, so they, I had to hide behind that area over this, just getting into it.Yeah, dude.Would I worry about doing this in Louisiana is someone who's got a gun.And it's like, I'm finally killing me a big foot.Yeah, yeah.You know?Well, there's people that are not smart and they are armed.Yeah, yeah.[1:01:00] Well, I mean, I didn't think about it.I was worried about them.I was worried about them more than they would be the alligators.Yeah, scaring Why people In that moment though I Actually, I was so got so nauseous because it was a hundred five degrees of smell and I don't want to I threw up And I couldn't leave the where I had to stay for the bit So I was just standing up sitting like in my own throw up.Oh God.Yeah.Jesus Christ.And then, like about 15 minutes in, they go, oh, see how I get back.And they point and there's an alligator.And it's coming at me.And I, I think it's even a guy, and I go, ah, and I turn and I run toward the boat screaming.And there was a fucking remote control alligator that they got that I didn't even know existed But it was an alligator and for a for a good 10 seconds My reality was that an alligator was coming at me.No, I wasn't mobile look at the outfit.I was in I couldn't really move That'll be the end of the show [1:02:01] Yeah, and then the end of the show, but you were thinking about the show, right?Yeah, I mean, I was like I cannot what about all the basic cable fans?What about the people that work behind the scenes?The real heroes?Yeah, yeah, it's but don't do those things dude.Yeah, don't fuck around with nature.You want to do silly things with humans?That's great.We start getting swamped.If you were in far between it, it sounds like we do a lot of it.If you wanna talk about Python, just clamp the whole of your leg and start wrapping around your body and you realize you're trapped.You're trapped in this stupid fucking swamp.Well, you can't see anything.You don't know how to get out.And this snake's trying to kill you.You don't even have a weapon.You have nothing to fight it off.I hope I go by surprise.That wouldn't be much of a surprise.It would the beginning would be a surprise.I don't want to go in the rest of death.I don't want to know that in minute, there's death eminent in the next one minute to hour or whatever the fuck it is.When a python wraps around you, I'd imagine it takes a little while.I bet the fear of it taking a while, it constricting you is probably fucking just numbing.You probably can't think.You're probably so overwhelmed with fear.[1:03:07] There's things constricting your body and literally breaking your bones.It's like crushing you.I'm so scared of death already.And I think of death all the time.And never have I thought of it in the light that we've been talking about tonight.So we just added a whole nice new bucket for me.Yeah, animals have things you really need to worry about.Yeah.My friend Paul Rosalie, he lives in the Amazon and he got on top of a anaconda that was so big, he couldn't get his arms around it.Yeah.Why?He was seeing this thing slither through the water and it was kind of dark out.And you'd have to go listen to the clip on YouTube to get the exact wording of how he said it, but he essentially wanted to try to hold on to it because it wasn't gonna try to combat.He took a chance and it wouldn't attack him.So he just, I don't know.[1:04:00] He's just fucking insane.Everyone thought he was insane.Big dude.Like why?I don't understand.It's so big that he couldn't get his arms around it.Is that what he's doing?Basically like my size, maybe a little bigger than me.He couldn't get his arms around it.Does he work with?Well he works with the rainforest.He works in the rainforest.He has to.No, no, no.His whole thing is is saving rainforest land.And what they do is they take these people that were hired as loggers and they pay them more money to protect the rainforest.Cause it's basically just poor people.And they're doing that.They've saved like millions of acres of rainforests and he's worked.So he actually lives out there.So he sees these things and he said, this is the biggest one he's ever seen.So you don't even know really how big the biggest one is.Yeah, it's just like the limited number that they've measured and come in contact with.Right.So what was his end game?I just wanted to like experience that I think, like just grab a hold of it.He didn't think it would bite him.I don't remember him talking about this.He tried to get eaten by a snake at one point, [1:05:00] about 10 years ago.He tried to they tried to different they filmed it for a show They tried he tried to get eaten by the biggest anaconda.They could find what they're gonna do They're gonna kill it when did you have like some quite a crazy suit on yeah, he had this suit on here that are preventing him from dying Fire oh god, that's so ridiculous.Yeah, I don't know how I got me and look it's got head around them Jesus Christ Wait what yeah, that's hilarious So that so that dumb idea balls So that suit is for running the strength of that snake from pushing him That's how did you see Jamie see if you could find that video of the largest anaconda ever discovered These guys are swimming under the water with it in this river.It's insane These guys are swimming under the water with it in this river.It's insane.That's what I was trying to do.It's insane.These guys are swimming down there in the water and this thing's moving along the bottom of the water.And it's head is like this big.It's like a crocodile or something.It's so big.It's head is like way bigger than you think a snake's head should be.[1:06:02] Like bigger than a human head.Under water is scary to me than the forest, even.Underwater is another planet.There's another aliens.They are aliens.And there's no doors.There's no doors.You never lock yourself in a room, like, woo!Finally, I'm all over.Nobody gets to relax.Wow, it's unobstructed.Yeah, there's no doors.Yeah, look at this.Whatever thing, dude look at this thing It's 26 feet long Look at these guys swimming by it and what is that eating?To sustain that size to sustain that size.What does that thing?Everything look at his right to it.Look at the He's got an official price goggles set from CVS.What is he doing?He's being a dork.Look at his outfit.He's got his watch on.He's got a mold.He might be one of them influencers.But whoever this fella is, or maybe he's just a scientist that's a young kid.But whoever this fella is, like, you got balls.Just assume that thing doesn't want to just eat.But it's not even balls though.It's not even balls though.It's like, it is balls.His name's Dr.Freak.So you still don't know [1:07:06] if he's a doctor or an influencer, then.Yeah, I don't know.Freak Vonk, is that what it's like?Dr.Freak dies fucking with a bowler.I can see it.What a great name.Dr.Freak.He sounds like he should be like, like a one of them DJs Yeah, Dr.Freak's here with the best name Marshmallow You heard the best name of her Salad man, just a great freaking name for like what for a human as a human name Yeah, like just as someone's first and last name I don't even thought about that nothing comes from mine.Yeah, I'm about you Someone just said some to me the couple days ago and I was like that is the fucking coolest name I've ever heard but I don't fucking remember.But like it's was something like Enrico Palazzo.It was like something like a good flairful.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Name is, if you, if you have a flairful name and you're a fucking loser, that's got a suck.Yeah, you know, you got some beautiful name when you turn out to be a loser.Yeah, he's a presenter, but he's also a doctor.Wait, that was what I want to talk, call him Dr.Freak if he's not really a doctor.[1:08:08] Was that a real bad thing?That's real.That's a bear with wings right there.That's a, but that's a perspective thing.If you've got to look where his feet are, he's standing behind it, the bats in front of the camera.Still, no, it's probably kind of big it's he's not that far behind his he's far enough it's a it's I mean yeah but if he got like right up to it it would be about that big no the rap body the body part you you you got close to it I don't which kind is it by the way how do those things exist and we don't talk about them.We'll see them more.Well wing length is five wing length is five feet.Okay It's like the foxes fox size.Oh, fuck that.Oh really like fox size.Yeah.Oh, okay.Look at this lady.Oh my god Dude, that one's fucking oh my god.Look at that.That's like bram stoker's Dracula.We're Gary Oldman turns into one of those [1:09:07] That's what it looks like who's who who's even going near those things?What are they?In Bali.There's a large, I guess fruit bats.We're so lucky.They just like fruit.Oh You know, yeah, so like so the same way cows feel about vegans like So happy you ever go over here to see bats.Oh, yeah Is it really 1.5 million?I didn't count.No, that's the stat they give you.Yeah, that's the stat.I don't know, but it's an insane amount of that.It's a sight to see.Oh, yeah, it's crazy.I've seen it from a distance, but I've never gone and stood there.It's cloud of bats.You get shit on?Well, you probably would if you were under them.You know, like where where the bridge meets the water.So I imagine when they're flying out, they shit on the water.You know, there was a couple doctors died because they were standing in front of this cave in Africa where bats, it's like fucking millions and millions of bats in this cave.And every night they would come out and they wanted to get photographs [1:10:00] of these bats coming out of the cave.So they're sitting there waiting, the bats come out of the cave.So they're sitting there waiting, the bats come out of the cave and just trench them in shit.Millions and millions of bats just shitting in their face and they didn't think of that.And they got some crazy hemorrhagic virus and they were both dead in like a matter of days.Again, I'm just taking another o-bit for that.Well, like, you know, you tell them, they're great-grangles, like yeah.The great-grangles, all they got shit on by too many bats at one time.Yeah.And it just went south from there.He was a bat scientist that didn't think about this one thing.Yeah, like what you know, one thing, you How do you not know that's about to happen or maybe they just didn't think would be the volume it would be See if you can find that case I've already looking I found it that sounds different.How did it come to be down here?How did it why is that why are they all here?It's a good question I don't know but apparently they eat the mosquitoes.There's more in Houston Oh really?Yeah, that's a migration and a mixture of two different colonies from like they fly for Mexico.They're so cool.When they come out at night and you hear them.[1:11:06] Yeah, that's the sound they make.You see I'm fucking fine.I'm like, well, look at them all.They're cool.And they apparently do just fuck those mosquitoes up.Imagine the bats weren't around.We had like way more mosquitoes.Because apparently they do have mosquitoes.Yeah.You guys don't have mosquito problems down here that I'm so weak.We do.We have, no, I wouldn't say it's a mosquito problem.Like Alaska has a mosquito problem.You ever been in Anchorage in July?No.Bro, you get out of your fucking car.I remember it was August 1st.You get out of your car, it's like a scene from the birds, like the Alfred Hitchcock movie, or Albert Hitchcock.No, I went to Australia and the desert and stuff, and they give you, we had to wear nets, because they just, like did the bugs just land on you and just stay there?Is it Alfred Hitchcock or Albert Hitchcock?Alfred, right?Yeah.Once you say it wrong, your brain goes, [1:12:02] wait, which one's the right one?Yeah.Those words, you don't hear Alfred or Albert anymore.Kids these days.No, there's so many things you don't hear.You do not get called Alfred.Alfred's dead.Yeah, Alfred.I've never heard that name.I think Alfred is probably more.It's a beautiful name.It is and I think it's probably more Alfred's than other names though.Adolf offs gone.Yeah, that's rap.Yeah, just you can name your kid gangus.Nobody would fucking flinch.Yeah, right?Do killed 10% population.I know everybody like wow, what a cool name.Oh, cool.It's virtual.You feel connected to the Mongols.Like everybody would be cool with that name.Is like as in con you can call them Temujin which is Genghis Khan's real name Because really yeah, that was a con was a stage name no, it was like Con he was a con the con is the ruler and I think I don't know what it means what is Genghis mean [1:13:03] It's crazy and it's something about who he is as a ruler.But his name, he was born, his name that he was given at birth was Temogen.Hmm.I didn't became a con.So you could call your kid Temogen, and you'd be naming your kid after someone who killed 10% of the population of Earth while he was alive.You think gangus have a thought as its ancestors would own the Jacksonville Jaguars?It says, Temmajin formally adopted the title Genghis Khan, the meaning of which is uncertain.At an assembly in 1206, carrying out reforms designed to ensure long-term stability, he then transformed the Mongols tribe structure into an integrated meritocracy dedicated to the service of the ruling family After Thwarting a coup attempt from a powerful shaman.Oh, what a wild time to be alive Warlords and shaman's are trying to get a coup on you Gangus began to consolidate his power in 1209.He let a large scale raid into the neighboring West Western Z [1:14:06] Who agreed to Mongol terms of following year?Yeah, he's done a lot of wild shit.We could go on and on for that He killed a lot of fucking humans man.Dan Karlin probably had the answer in his Podcast about that probably right this is just the from the Wikipedia.Yeah Yeah, Dan Karlin's podcast is the best source of that.If you want to know like a cool story that's entertaining, that you could follow along with, it's the wrath of the con.The wrath of the con.It's all about that, dude, I was like, but my point is like, you could name your kid Temmaging.Nobody would freak out.Name your kid Adolf and he can't hang out with my kids.Yeah, right.You what's number two?Eight off is a layup, right?And there's no way everyone knows no eight off.Right.Is there a, is there even a two?Is it just he alone on the zone?I think he's alone on his own.Yeah.Right.Because like Joseph Stalin existed before I was born.[1:15:00] I'm Joseph Rogan.Like nobody flinched on Joseph.Yeah.I'm Joseph Rogan like nobody flinched on Joseph.Yeah Such a piece of shit, but yet you can still say it.Oh, some a bit lot.Oh, yeah Well the rest these are not real.Yeah, Osama would be a hard one.Yeah, that's a hard one who's saying would be a hard one Legal baby names in the United one.A legal baby named Znina of the States.Illegal?What?Jesus Christ, you can't name me, could Jesus Christ.You can't name your kid King.You're kidding me, you're kidding me, right?You can't name the kid, it's a law.Ah!You can't name your kid Santa Claus.You can't name him the atsimals.don't you can't name your your your your your kid majesty?Why not?Why can't you name it 1069 wait a minute?You can't name your kid Messiah, but you can name him Muhammad right?Help me out.No doesn't make any help me out because a lot of kids are named Muhammad.Yeah.Yeah [1:16:01] Yeah, but why but why 1069 what the hell is that?Robocopop illegal in Mexico No my friend No, we draw the line my friend You know what's funny is that like is that like they getting caught in the hospital?So it has to get words and then I'm not gonna do it one day.It's a police like you got to rename your son right now See your, it will Robo cop.This is from the, yes, per certificate.Robo cop Martinez.Oh my God.Oh my God.The N words on there.Yeah, there's a lot of them.There's a lot of illegal names.I didn't know.I didn't know you couldn't name your kid Jesus Christ, but I know a dude named Hans Wooz.Sure.This is Jesus, I mean, this is Jesus.Right.Can't feel the Christ in that.What if your last name is Christ?And you want to name your kid, hey, Suz?I mean, there's some Christs out there.Yeah.Some dudes, their last name is Christ.Yeah.What are they supposed to do?They didn't You can't do that.How come you can name yourself Muhammad?How come you can't name your son Jesus?[1:17:06] Think about how many Muhammad's or think about it was like...If it was invoked to name your kid Jesus.Why?Just millions of Jesus.So many Jesus'.Because if you think about how many Muhammad's there are, why are they not an equal number of Jesus'?We don't allow it.It's a weakness in our religion.Because if you think about how many Muhammad's there are, why are there not an equal number of Jesus'?Right.We don't allow it.It's a weakness in our religion.That would be come meta.Because Jesus would be really omnipresent.Yeah, the Christians should get together and say, guys, it's a weakness in our religion.We gotta let people name themselves Jesus.Yeah, I mean, it's encouraging.I'm gonna change the name of Jesus.I'm gonna change the name of Jesus.You know what I mean?Jesus Robinson.Yeah.Everybody just comes Jesus and then whatever your last name is.You know, I knew it Jesus and as I'm thinking of this, I was able to compartmentalize it.I didn't think of Jesus every time I called Him Jesus.Was he actually Jesus?He was called Jesus.Not Jesus.We call Him Jesus.Yeah But was he Mexican?He was of some like Hispanic descent.I don't know what.[1:18:05] Did his mom call him Jesus?He was my nephew's friend.I didn't know him like.But everybody called him.They call him Jesus because they couldn't say Jesus or there was this.They were actually Jesus.I think his name was Jesus.Really?Yeah.What about Jesus the comic?There's a dude that's...Trago, right?Oh, Jesus.No, that's Jesus.Michael and Jesus.Okay.Yeah.Right.But he's Mexican.They don't say that one.They don't say that one.Yeah.It's a different thing.But how do they say Jesus though in Spanish?Is it in Jesus Christe?It is, but we- So it's Jesus.Everybody't that wild?Stop for a second.So if you're Spanish of Latin descent, it is really popular to name your kid Jesus.Because Jesus is a super common name.That's what it is.It's stuck up white people in America.Won't name their kid Jesus.It just takes a courageous person right now listening to our voice.Just a courageous person out there to name your kid Jesus.[1:19:04] If you name them Jesus, that second second name that last name has to be Yeah, it's got to go with it.I think a lot of things won't go with Jesus.You know what goes best with it?fucking Jesus Jesus fucking Robin Can you do that?Can you name your middle name fucking that'd be so great?I don't know if you can but I think you can legally change your name more likely than you can be naming a baby that way.Okay, yeah.Cause your name would be like you rude asshole.You're gonna name your kid, this little beautiful innocent baby, you're gonna name Jesus fucking Robert.Right?Right.Right.Right.No, you'd have to, but if you were an adult, you'd like look, I'm 38 years old, things are not getting any better.This is life for me.I want to be Jesus fucking Robinson.That's what I want to be legally.So very least I pull my ID out.What's your name?Jesus fucking Robinson.It's good.[1:20:00] It says it on the wall.It's a good name.It's all the name.Especially if you could do something real good.If that's your actual real birth name and you're really good at like fucking fixing cars.Yeah.You know what I mean?You're gonna get your car fixed, but it's fucking robbing, too.I was almost a Steve.My mom told me.I was almost a Steve.My dad's south, so I thankfully I got as a name.That's a better name for an Italian.Steve is a, you know.I'm half.Yeah, but you look Italian.I do.I actually just did 23 of me, like all the extended package genetic thing.I just got my results by a couple of days ago.Pretty crazy.Do you do like what did you like did you like what you glean from it like it was an interesting or it was pretty much what I thought it was yeah I'm Somewhere in the neighborhood of three quarters Italian and one quarter Irish and there's There's like percentages less because there's like one point six percent African one percent Asian and that's it seems to be mostly just Italian [1:21:02] Yeah, it all goes back to the same.Mine were, they were able to connect me to, it's set in there, there's like about, the woman, it was 150,000 years for the male, it was 275,000 years.They said if you trace everyone back, it'll go to one person.Because even though there were a few thousand, those, a lot of those, that DNA and that lineage died off.And this is, like, there was this one that, like, just ended up getting through.Like, it literally just read it, like today.I took a picture of it on my phone actually.I mean, let's see.Just the unliklihood of you making it to 2024.Like, your genes, if you were a person that lived 50,000 years ago, your kid had a kid and kept going, no, they had a kid, someone had a kid, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, here we are, 50,000 years later, your genes are still popping.It's insane.It's just wild to me, yeah.[1:22:01] So the first man to carry likely lived this gene I have like lewd in southwestern Asia Or the Caucasus between 46,000 and 54,000 years ago His male line descendants appeared to remain rooted in the region for tens of thousands of years while the ice age was in full swing Then around 11,500 years ago the ice age finally gave way to the warm climate blah blah blah blah blah But hold on, this is the guy.The human species was confined to a relatively small range in eastern South Africa.Over time, members of this gene pool migrated.If it was warm and said you could trace it, right?If every person living today could trace his or her maternal line back over thousands of generations, all of our lines would meet a single woman who lived in Eastern Africa between 150,000 to 200,000 years ago.Though she was one of perhaps thousands of women alive at the time, only the diverse branches of her DNA have survived to today.[1:23:02] The story of your maternal line begins with her.Holy shit.And for the guys, it's 275,000 years ago.Current evidence suggests he was one of thousands of men who lived in Eastern Africa.However, while his male line descendants passed down their Y chromosome generation after generation, the lineage is from the other men died out.After time, he was the lone guy.And this is, they told me I'm related to this dude, you ready?Literally a known guy, O.T.the Iceman.No way.I swear to God, let me reach this.I freaking.I've seen that story a hundred times.Have you?That story's crazy.This is what it says about this dude, hold on.It says, O.T.the Ice man was discovered in 1991 protruding from a snow bank.Yeah, look at Jamie to show some pictures of.Yeah, we've shown it before.Oh, you know, you know, I know the exact story.So that's it right there.Look how dope it looks.They found him as the glacier melted.That's my, I got an arrowhead stuck in him.That's like my uncle.That's nuts, dude.Yeah, that's your, you're related to that guy.Holy shit.I mean, isn't that saying?Well, I mean, we probably a lot of people are oh it's tattoos [1:24:09] Did he really?Yeah tattoos really?Yeah We looked like Had the world oldest tattoos it said see if you can go back to that thing that you were reading just there right below that right there That's it Had the world's oldest tattoos, how are they made?The oldest tattoos that we know about right?See it 61 tattoos.Which is, yeah like a tramp stamp?Yeah, yeah, a tramp stamp.Oh, it's a bunch of lines carved in them, interesting.Look at that, all those lines.Even back then they're like tattoos.Yeah, and they're wild.Yes.Might've been a part of ancient healing technique.That's just guessing, right?It's said that he was murdered.Did you see that?Oh, he was the arrow, but it said he might have been from someone or might have been someone that he knew.Mm.Chemical analysis of his teeth indicate he came from the Italian side of the Alps.He suffered during the year before his death [1:25:01] with whipworm, a stomach parasite that was found in his digestive tract, yet he was fit enough, eiling with whipworm for a year to climb 6,500 feet in elevation during the day or two before he met his end in a rocky Alpine Hollow.Apparently was murdered, struck by a stone arrow point that was found lodging his left shoulder.The twisted position of his body indicates that the murderer, or one of his accomplices pulled the arrows shaft out of his prone body Wow, whoever killed him didn't want his valuables because he had a rot copper axe still still with him Wow, they just wanted to kill him Wow and you're related to that dude that dude jizzed in someone Literally, yeah before he died by an arrow He jizzed in someone that made it to 2024.I'm not here if he's not there.No, you're not here if he didn't get that nut off That's fucking yeah probably some tattooed up crazy cave lady two of them just grunt and smell like shit [1:26:02] Two of them just grunt and smell like shit I mean not What's up, baby?Can we have fucking baby and fucking 50,000 years later show on truth We're on TBS now actually it's kind of really is kind of crazy if you think about how the the timeline of people goes I mean, it's we can't imagine living back then.It's just unimaginable.I can't put it in my head.How long ago?What is the exact thousand years ago that guy's supposed to live?That one said 50,000.I mean who can wrap that up?5,300 years ago.Okay.But the first man was 200 and they have DNA from his 275.So he's from 5,000 years ago.Just imagine.53,000.He's a kid.Imagine 5,000 years ago you just get dropped off.And you have to just exist.Yeah, I mean, even imagine like language, right?Even the primary language is like, it's still with secular.[1:27:03] Even if you had to travel somewhere and you had some type of language that you kind of rooted with who you were with, that didn't translate when you came across someone that you didn't know.Yeah, you go to Vietnam.Good luck talking to people.So was it just I guess like, you know, was it killing people on site or did they kind of go by like body language?I think people who traveled had to learn languages for sure.Yeah, you probably had to have people help you or work with somebody from that but How many of them can you learn?Like and where if you're living in Somewhere in North America and you go to China and like the 1800s.Yeah, how much Communication can you do?Did you oh did you see that new that new thing they're working on, the AI earpiece?It's fucking nuts, is it?Ted talk about it.So this guy, he's like, okay, this is an all new thing that they're doing.He's in a restaurant.He goes, my friends across the other ones are in the restaurant.Did you see that?Then he isolates his voice.And then he's speaking in Spanish and they do real time, not translation.[1:28:06] His voice is reinterpreted in his voice in English as he speaks Spanish in real time.And he's hearing this isolated from across the room.That's fucked up.It's crazy.I mean, in one respect, you literally eliminate every single language barrier across earth with this technology.But in the other, you're Superman.You can listen to a conversation, it can isolate a conversation from a, you know, it's I think it can only isolate that conversation if those people have those things on too.But why would anyone wear that?Well, you would have to let someone use it.You know what I'm saying?Like if you were talking to someone through that on the other side, am I wrong?No, they weren't talking.He was listening to his conversation.He was just listening to just I thought it was the people in the room having the conversation.This guy was in a they were doing this guy was in the room with the earpiece on.He's looking at a clear across the room at two people at a table talking and he's just listening.So he said isolate.Oh, I misunderstood.I thought when I saw the narrating that what they were saying, [1:29:06] what he was saying was you could do that if you were those two people, you could isolate.No.Oh, you could just listen to that.Yeah.Oh.Yeah.Oh, that's fucking creepy.But he wasn't pitching, this is the TED talk.So it's like, I don't know what the technology, yeah.technology.Yeah.Hey, uh, can you enhance the sounds that are right in front of me?How far away is he from them?I think he says in the beginning they're across the room or something.Oh, I guess he's.And, uh, can you turn that baby down?No, he's on That's better.You know, I'm still having a little trouble hearing Pedro.Can you isolate Pedro for me?No, he's on stage right now for the TED Talks, so he's not with them.Manek Hamos, that's perfect.And you know, my Spanish is a little rusty.Can I hear Pedro but in English?Yeah.And at the end of the trip, we came back to the city [1:30:03] to visit the historic center.That's the same.Show close all programs.That's the same.What you just let it go.TURG was a beamforming app with a computational auditory scene analysis app, a machine learning denoising app, an AI transcription and translation and text-to-speech with style transfer app.So these are not just fancy looking earbuds.They're an entire computer and We think they're gonna replace some of what we do with the visual computers that we're used to Right cuts off right there.He's the thing though What was he watching was he watching a video of people talking and then do that because that makes more sense I don't think he's actually eavesdropping on people across the room I think what he's doing is watching a video of people having a conversation and tuning in to those people and taking all the outside noise out and then translating those people in that video in real time.I think.What's he watching a video of those people?I think he's watching a video.Okay.Which makes more sense.[1:31:01] Okay.Is that right?No, I'm alright.Well that the problem is is that they're showing something that probably doesn't work that way also They're bullshit Um, but when they're showing it are there why he's watching a video though, right?That's why I'm trying to show you what they're doing because he's on stage Yeah, he's on stage.It's not like it just happens to be a cafe in the room where no one's noticing correct But he that's part of why it's just a weird tech demo of showing you don't really know what they were doing and how much work was set up to do that specific very split.Did it just translate the sentence?They wanted it to translate.And was it all planned in advance?And then they show like they did do a setup here.So I'll let him explain what they did.So it's actually impossible to demonstrate this experience until you hear it with your ears yourself.But to give you an idea, we have tried to simulate it for you.Oh, OK.So imagine that you're sitting in a noisy restaurant.Oh, OK.OK.So it doesn't work in that.Yeah.But it's going to be able to do that.[1:32:01] If he's doing a TED talk on it it and they're getting this far along with it, unless he's like, what's that crazy lady, Elizabeth?What's her name?What's her name again?Elizabeth one, I want, Theranos, it's a name.Theranos.But was her last name?The crazy lady from San Francisco with the blood company.You know what I'm The Varanos?Oh yay!Let us see how it ended up just was straight bullshit.It was a whole trip.It was a trial, man.Oh yeah, she's lost.Yeah, I mean, the story behind it is crazy.It's like some people were testing them and they're like, hey, this doesn't work.I'd get out of here.Like, the little little, just this wild scam.I have my DNA, this These are saved.DNA and sperm.Yeah.Yeah.I got, I'm more, I had the option.I was like, let me do it.You might as well.You got all the way from the ice man to today.Be shame for you.Oh yeah.You know, if they died here, that's it.Did you hear about the cryogenic people?You know, like they started cryogenically freezing people.Yeah, some of them like it didn't work.No.The one like headline was like, [1:33:05] yeah, they were scraping, goo off the bottom of the thing.Oh, yeah.Whoops.Oh, wow.Yeah, like if the power goes out and you thought, that's what happened.That shit's fascinating.Isn't it only like one company or something that's doing that or a- Imagine if you're to heaven, and you're like, God, I'm free of all my earthly polls, and I just feel one connected and also, and shhup, you get sucked back to life again, and they're stitching your fucking head on this new body, and you're alive now, but you're paralyzed, but with new technology, they can keep you alive forever, right?No!No!And what year is it?Congratulations Walt Disney's back.No!You're a stripping.You're a stripping.Imagine if you were in heaven.Yeah.Imagine if during the process of reattaching your head it made your mouth paralyzed so you couldn't even talk.Hell.That's hell.[1:34:00] It's like the fucking movie where they eat each other so too and the's ass could you imagine if you're you're dead for like a hundred years and a hundred years of heaven This is so much nicer than being alive.Oh my god.Everyone's just there's no arguments It's just love beauty and and just the expression of love and geometric patterns and it flows through you And we all bathe in it.No one needs to eat, no one needs to sleep.It's just love and also like a funnel.Clear, fucking you back to.Oh, yeah.I just stitch in your fucking head.You can't talk as your mouth paralyzed.Yeah, and they pay for that.Psh, a lot of money, too, probably.Also, I think it's more money if you want the whole body.The one thing I was like thinking is like, let's say, let's just say, right?It works the way, one day, the way that they thought it would work.What are you coming back to?Everybody that didn't do it is dead, you know no one.You probably are to adjust to the wherever society there and now, who knows how people would treat you?You're really signing up for something, [1:35:07] what are you signing up for?I think they're signing up for the hope that if they do get reincarnated, it's like space 2001.You get reincarnated to this crazy, futuristic world where they could sht.Welcome back.Welcome back.How was your trip, sir?You think they're trying to preserve consciousness?They're consciousness?I don't know what consciousness is really.Here's the question.I mean, I know I'm conscious.I know you can have this conversation.I think therefore I am.I know I get it.I don't know if consciousness is something the brain tunes into or whether the brain is conscious.I know if you damage parts of the brain, it damages parts of your consciousness and damages different things that you can do.And they're pretty clear on what parts of the brain are responsible for different things.But I'm not sure that consciousness is something as simple as neurons firing and your brain [1:36:09] interfacing with the world and using all its senses.I have a feeling that we might be short-sighted because we can't, and again, this is not scientifically provable, so you have to be just speculative about something like this.But I have a feeling there's probably quite a few things that we're not totally in tune with to the point where we can measure them.And I think consciousness might be one of those things.And I also think we are all weirdly connected in some strange consciousness web, some strange net of human beings.I think we're all connected, all of us.It's just a further those people are away, the less you feel that connection.But I think we're all oddly connected already.Before we get to the cell phones in your head and everybody being telepathic, I think we're already oddly connected.[1:37:00] We just don't necessarily feel it all the time.Yeah, I hope it's something.I mean, I really do You have it you have it think did you have a moment where you think I might die like to die I've come across like did you have that feeling?I was a kid when I was like 14 mean a few friends were playing around in this Place where they stored these like enormous concrete place where they stored these like enormous concrete like sewer pipes like these big fucking pipes and there was this this giant metal thing that I guess it was a part of like what they were attached to a crane so they could move these things and it slipped and hit me in the head.And I didn't go unconscious, but I grayed out, like grayed out, and my head was pouring.Blood is still a big ding on the side of my head from it.And I went to the hospital and like I thought it was gonna die.I did think I was gonna die at that point, [1:38:00] but I was also 14, so I was probably just freaked out with the fact that I got hit.You know, like this thing hit my head and it only fell like a certain amount because there was other Concrete things in the way so it banged me in the head and then it didn't fall on me luckily But you like I was thinking you had the feeling like I was I got hit so hard it hit me so hard It was so big.I was like this could be a real problem This could be a real I was, I could be dead right now for sure.So you having those thoughts on running through your mind?Yeah, it's fine.I was okay.I went to the hospital.I'm sure I had some sort of a concussion.They treated me, I forget what they did, but then they just let me go home.You know, and I was just, they were like, oh, he's okay.Because I don't think they understood head trauma back then.I don't think people really got it.And I don't remember really suffering any like serious consequences of it.I was never like, I never had a problem like looking at the light.I never had a problem with loud noises or anything like that.Yeah.[1:39:00] But it was spooky.That was probably the closest I come to just really worrying about being dead.I had warned, but it wasn't in that it was in on a plane.Yeah, it was bad.To this day, if I think about it, I actually will have a little bit of an anxiety attack.It was a small plane.We had to do a show in the middle of nowhere on the road and they offered a plane.We had to do a show in the middle of nowhere on the road and they offered a plane.So we took it and we were flying back home and it was like a 80 plane, whatever it was.And I don't like flying at all anyway.Nevermind, people were like, oh, cool.You got to do that.I'm like, I mean, I don't like it.You see everything.There's no door in the cockpit.You see all the motion.You know what I mean?I mean, it's just like, I, this feels unsafe.It's like I'm flying in a toy airplane.You know what I mean?Any gust of wind, that's normal.We'll just, we kind of glide with it.You know what I mean?I don't want to feel like we're up there like surfing.You know what I mean?guys, my guy and my friends, and we're talking, and then the guy, right before we land, he goes back up again.[1:40:07] And I look at them and I go, what just happened there?Like why are we going back up?And the guy, the copilot comes back, goes, guys, we have a little bit of a situation.And he goes, what, he goes, so we were about to land just now, you might have noticed, like, yeah, he goes, So as well, we were talking to air traffic control, and our panel up here is saying that one of the wheels is not coming down.The left wheel or whatever.And so what we're gonna do is it could be a broke, the panel's broken, and it could actually be down.We don't know, so we're gonna fly around again, and we're gonna ask them to look again, just to make sure.He's like, so it'll just be be a couple minutes.So we made this big turn and we go down to land again And again, we're getting down to like low low though.They pull back up He comes back out.This is what his mother fuckers says he says Okay, so they can't tell It was at night.I don't know.We're a small plane.Maybe it's like a bullshit airport.He goes so they can't tell this is what, he goes, but we don't have enough fuel to get anywhere else.[1:41:09] So we're gonna go around a third time and this time we're gonna lay in the plane no matter what.So I'm looking at him, I immediately just crying.I'm like, not not crying like, but like I'm just whirling up with tears, I'm going to die.My biggest, one of my biggest fears is dying in a plane crash.I don't even like to think about it because I don't even want to put it out there.And I'm like, oh my God.And I'm like, look at that.And I'm like, what's going to happen?And he goes, in all seriousness, he goes, don't worry.If the wheel doesn't come down or if it doesn't, isn't down, the wing will act like a wheel.That's what he said to us.Because the wing is made to like kind of act like a wheel.It didn't give me any comfort in the moment.It does.It slows down the plan.Yeah, but we're still yes, spinning out and sparks flying from little plane, you know, no good.Yeah.And um, oh, actually, no, that was the night at night time was the, uh, that it was the same exact trip there and back.The nighttime trip, it was like a storm and we flying all the, this was the daytime [1:42:06] because they had fire trucks and ambulances lining on them and the thing, because by the time the third time we went out, they were there.So they were, they were waiting.That's another scary thing.I actually took out my phone and I wrote a text to my entire family.I have, I saved text.I'm just like, there's a problem with the wheel.I don't know exactly what's gonna happen.I'm literally like, I love you.I just send that.Okay, now like as you hit.I literally wrote it in front.As I was crying.I wrote it in full as I was crying and I had it open with my hand right on the thing.Oh, fuck.So I was just gonna wait and if it just, I felt like I could just hit it.I have the text that I see.And my friend such a fucking asshole.I'm nervous.Everyone's really nervous, but I think I'm shown at the most.My buddy is a nutcase.So he looks at me and he goes, he's trying to calm me down.And he goes, just calm down, calm down, calm down.And I'm like, all right, he goes just relax.And then he starts going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.And it starts singing fucking La Vamba.And it breaks the tension, everything.[1:43:05] And I'm like, dude, and I'm crying and laughing so hard because when you're in that heightened state of emotion, dude, I'm laughing as hard as I'm crying.Now, now I'm like, I can't even, I'm laughing so hard, I can't breathe, I can't stop doing it because I need to be focused right now on the end of my wife and he was Hello, baby because the big popper like and died for rich balance So he goes hello, baby, and I am literally can't breathe and I'm I'm holding my stuff He's like will I what and then I'm just like dude I'm begging him please stop.I'm like laughing crying please stop joke and And then we went to land and the wheel was out.The wheel was out, man.Man, we got out of the plane.And everybody was like in good spirits and I was still in that place.And the fireman came over.The first thing that happened was the fire guy opened the door [1:44:02] and looked at him and he goes, oh shit.He goes, got, can I get a picture?And we get out of the plane and it's the four of us that him take a picture.I have the picture and it was smiling.I'm on the end like this.Just pale white.Just not no smile.Just like, oh no.Yeah, like I couldn't even turn it on for the picture.Oh no.It was my biggest fear coming true.Like, you know, like, you go there.You literally go there.That's what I was saying.I was thinking this could be how I die right now.And I, oh man, where it takes you is nuts in your head.Have you seen this new plane that they've developed that doesn't have wings?And it's gonna be able to fly to London from New York City super quick.Way faster, less than half the size.It looks like a spaceship, man.And apparently it's got, because it doesn't have a traditional shape, there's a lot more room inside of it, so it's fucking huge.What?Yeah.What's the technology?I don't know.[1:45:00] I was just looking at some article about it.And it's a new supersonic craft that looks like, instead of like, it looks like a giant arrowhead or something.Okay.It doesn't look like a regular plane.Like that's what it looks like.Oh, like that.That's it right there?Oh, that's on it, dude.Oh, so you fly from New York in 3.5 hours and this new supersonic jet.Can I see what the images look like?Oh, so this is going to be commercially market.I thought it was like military.That one seems like it.That seemed like a military jet.The one that I saw looked like that thing.That's it.That's it.90 minutes.Look at that.Look at that.That's ridiculous.Look at that thing.It looks like a train.That's the same thing.Okay.It looks like.That's just a view from the top.So you can see it doesn't have like a regular wing.It just has this crazy immense space in the back.And you're gonna, you're gonna have room to like stretch out.They'll just stuff it with humans, but probably not because it's probably gonna be super expensive.[1:46:00] That's only got room for one person.That can't be the same thing, is it?A passenger one?It's an expensive ticket.There was talking about one that could seat passenger.It's just commercial routes, but.Hmm.There's like one dude.This one.No, but I think there was one that they were working on.Maybe I'm conflating two different stories, but there's one jet that they're working on that does not have wings.And they were talking about it being able to have more space inside of it because of that.Who's going on that like, who's going, like once it's like approved, there's a first flight, there's the first commercial flight.There it is, that's it, that's the thing.Look at that fucking thing, bro.That's crazy.Look at that thing.That looks like a UFO.Wingless supersonic jet could transport pastures from London to New York in less than five hours.How long does it take now?Wait, what?I don't know.It's like six hours.Yeah, it's not much faster.Less than an hour faster, but you get to fly in a spaceship.That's not fast at all.An hour faster?That's crazy.But it's supersonic.And it doesn't fit in the airport.Look at it.It looks That futuristic spaceship like aircraft, capable of transporting back and up a little circular, [1:47:06] transporting 300 passengers at speeds of up to 1,150 miles an hour.Oh wow, that's faster.That's like double the speed of a regular jet.Even more, right?A little bit more.Yeah, look how dope it looks though.Bedrooms, bathroom, suite.Yeah, see, so the inside of it is so different because it does now have that tube that it's got like space.Yeah, but how are we, how are we commercializing that?Like that cabin is gonna be comfortable?I don't know.You're not gonna feel 1100 miles an hour?I guess not, I mean, we don't feel 5,600, right?Well, once you're up, once you're up and moving, would you feel as the resistance of like getting off the ground, right?You feel like this pull and then once you level out in You know, whatever the the height that you're gonna achieve is whatever the altitude is It doesn't feel like you're moving at all.Yeah, and you're going 500 miles an hour It's made by a designer.It's just as it's a concept I don't know.It's just like a private room for two travelers with, living room, and an in-sweet shower room in the living room, fine leather, double seat sofa, complete with dining tables, [1:48:10] a 32 inch flat screen TV noise canceling headsets, a comfortable double bed, a full-height shower, vanity unit bathroves, and an in-flight chef at your service.I got to tell you, the flat screen TV, it really gets more credit than it is.That's a jet that goes 1200 miles an hour.That has a home in the air that goes 1200 miles an hour.And they're like, it boasts a 32 inch flat screen TV.One was the last time you saw a screen.What was a bubble?When did, can we stop saying flat screen?But it's like, what do you, the thing is, who is it for?Who can purchase that ticket?And you're like, one of the things I'm dangling in front of you is a 32 inch flat screen television.It says right here, nobody has shown interest in building the sky OV EVO yet, but Oscar said he is offering his expertise to engineers helping them in other projects.[1:49:00] So this is just an idea.Bro, you can easily get a hold of them Saudi Arabian dudes.That's who, that's it though.Well guys, with all that loot, they might go, Hey, how much to make it work?Yeah, how much?I like a guy who's like, they're like, how much is like, Alright, it's two billion.He's like, alright, you throw one of 32 inch flasker and you've got't do it.I can't do it.Make sure I get it right.My hands are tied.Let me go talk to my manager.Let me go talk to my manager.We never do this.We never do this.We never do this.We never do this.We never do this.We never do this.We never do this.We never do this.We never do this.To give you the flat screen with your fucking space.Shope.Saudi wife walks outside our house on Christmas as one of the driver with a bow on it.Yeah.They probably like this.Stevie's bullshit.Look how small.Look at the revolution.Just get through this.I want a big one.32 inch flat.Just say flat screen.That is not that big.Yeah, why not?Just say why not put it's 85.85 there's like a hundred even flat screen why say that yeah done everybody know [1:50:08] Your car comes with four round tires Oh, it's a flat screen around tires.Hey, um, what kind of tires you have?Everybody have round tires why do they keep calling them round tires?Super fun flight thing would be a 12 rows of 33 people each imagine being in the middle.Oh god If you have to piss oh my god, you didn't get a bedroom seat.Oh my god.What are the other things they boasted about A shower a TV 32 inch flat screen TV noise cancelling headsets You can't see the other people in the poor section scream Double seat sofa what imagine someone fucking going ballistic, while you're going a thousand miles an hour, because people go ballistic on planes now.It's kind of a new thing.They go crazy, see aliens, they start screaming, they're gonna take the plane out.Like it happens, it seems like once a month, there's some new video of some guy going bonkers.Some guy just ripped off and ran up in the aisle, [1:51:01] stay at the land.I just saw that.Oh, God.Just imagine the fear that you would have if you were on a plane and you saw some guy going bonkers, you know, like, God, damn it.The anxiety you'd have, like, fuck.Yeah.As soon as you hear it start, you're like, what's this going to be?What is this going to be?What if it's like a new disease?What if it's like that?Did you ever see that movie 28 days later?Yeah.When they shot the chimps up with this thing called rage.Yeah, rage.Chimps gets out.Yeah.And gets that dude and then the fucking...Was that that first zombie movie that were like, they were like super fast, right?Yeah, that was great.one of like five movies I've seen two days in a row.The second one's good too.I went to it opening next, I was like, this is amazing and I didn't like it as much.Well the first one was so revolutionary.You know, it was just, and it was a different concept.Like a man created zombie virus that just infects everyone immediately instantly turns you into a fucking monster.[1:52:06] Yeah.But the thing is that virus is kind of like what rabies is.Right.Rabies isn't as effective because it doesn't turn you into a screaming, running maniac trying to bite people.But the reason why animals with rabies bite you, they have no fear of you and they bite you to give you rabies.They're trying to give it to you.Really?Yeah.You're saying that something in the composition of rabies elicits the need to pass it on?100%.How does that, how does, I don't, but I can't compute that.There's a lot of examples in nature of viruses and parasites, tricking organisms into doing things that are not in their best interest.And I think a virus could easily find a way to hijack the way an animal's mind works and to force it to be aggressive [1:53:01] if it wanted to be transmitted a lot.That's the only reason why I would make sense of it is because if they're so aggressive, they could risk death.Like an animal being recklessly aggressive is not good for its longevity, right?Because you could be recklessly aggressive with a wolf or something that could kill you.And you run up on it, it just eats you.But if you could bite it first, then you can give it rabies.And then that thing's gonna bite a bunch of other things Especially it's big enough to kill you now can bite everything like there was a bunch of travelers that went across the country Like during the Lewis and Clark expedition a couple of them.I believe got rabies.I think more than one of them Got rabies see if we find that what's it's not that it kills everybody.It's not now I know they have rabies shop, but let's say without the shot, is that, is that, certain death?No.Yeah, it's like, it's like 99 points, something percent certain death.There's a few people that have survived now, they're figured out a way to put people into medically induced comas.And the problem is, this is obviously coming from someone who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.But what I understand is that it's a very, very old virus and a dangerous one.[1:54:08] Because what it does is it works faster than your immune system can fight it off.And so your immune system is fighting off rabies, but it can't win.rabies just just, it just hijacks everything and makes its way through.And by putting someone in a medically induced coma, they've found a way to reach equilibrium, where the resources of the person's body are not being required anymore and the immune system could fight off the rabies and with medication they were able to do it.But they also can get you, if you just got bit.Yeah, how much time do you have?You have very little time, but really hours.Oh, sure, you gotta get to the hospital.Where could I go?And they'll test and they'll, hopefully they'll, if you have the animal that killed you, they wanna test the animal, but they'll give you these shots that are apparently like brutally painful.I think they go into your stomach.Like, what did I ask you to Google right before that?[1:55:02] This looks heavy.The Lewis and Clark thing, but I didn't see that.Some of them now digging up like maybe it's another traveler, but.The Lewis and Clark thing, you didn't hear about a guy getting rabies?Didn't see anything with that, really.I might have been another one of them.Dude's making it across the country stories, which I've read a lot of.They're fucking terrifying those days were terrifying, but it's just like a virus like that that wants to be transmitted and then tricks the animal to being aggressive.That's one of the weird things about viruses.They're so sneaky and how they evolve.Yeah.Like these new COVID strains, they realize the best thing to do is to be like super transmissible, but not that bad.Right.That way you stay alive.Right.Right.Right.You don't kill the host, you know, and like there's so many instances in nature of things like tricking things and doing stuff, you know, like parasites that take over an animal's body, force it to do stuff.Yeah.[1:56:00] Bleak.It's weird.The weirdest one is we were talking about the other day, grasshoppers to get this aquatic worm.There's aquatic worm climbs inside of it, hijacks his brain, and when it's ready to give birth, tricks the grasshopper into drowning itself so that it could be born.So it just takes over the grasshopper's brain and then leaps into the fucking water so it can be born.And so the grasshopper just drowns and it just, that's how the grasshopper's building.That's wild.Tricks it into commanding suicide.What the evolution of that exactly is that?Like how the hell the fuck?Yeah.And how is it so common?It's so insanely common apparently.That's wild.Yeah.That's fucking wild.So grasshop Grasshoppers, they have a number one look off with this fucking thing.I think they just have it.I think a lot of them have it.I think they've done studies on grasshoppers and I think they've done this on praying mantises too, but a lot of them have these worms in their bodies.How often do you see Grasshopper all the time?[1:57:01] You do?Well, man.I haven't seen one of the years.Where are you living?I live in New York Yeah, I know but you gotta go where grasshoppers live.They don't come visit.But where do they live?Is it just grass?I mean they live in open fields I encounter grass.You know what I mean?Yeah, but you have a camera in the neighborhood?No That's what I've seen them in the past.I haven't been in the past.I guess there's probably a few.I bet you I've seen less than 10 grasshoppers in front of my face in my life.Wow.Yeah.That's crazy.No, I've seen a lot of them.To pray, man, this is, you mentioned that days, they, I don't like them at all.right on the thing and I was a road trip.My friends were going to DC and it was like in the middle of the night and I'm getting guests.My friend, it was back in the days when he had like, hey, in health camcorders.And we're like, oh, look at that thing.And I'm like, dude, just like, I'm just like right here.And he goes, take the camcorder.I'm gonna get the guests.I'm filming the thing and It looks like that fucking, what's that movie, that alien?No, no, the movie with the- [1:58:05] Starship True Earth.With the person standing in the corner, it was like that horror movie that like got a handheld camera.Oh Blair Witch?Blair Witch?Because when we watched the footage, you just hear me go, yeah!My voice got so high and then the camera just drops and it just goes to static.But you see it lunge at me first.Yeah, we're lucky there little huh.Why do they rip?What is that about the ripping of the head off?What do you mean?The pre-emptus, the female rips the male's head off after they have sex.Well, she's just a bitch.Is that it?That's a lot of it.A lot of it in the insect community.Is that true, right?Yeah, one of the worst ones is ants.male and the females will take the male and cut all of his legs off and just drag them to the colony.It's got his legs off.It's fun when this is like a history of rabies and I got to this part of the hair of the dog.What is that?And work your way back to get this.How they used to treat rabies before they understood what the fuck it was.Oh, is that what that reference is from here?[1:59:01] It was recommended to salt and eat the flesh of the offending dog.Oh my god.Another strategy included drowning a puppy of the same sex as the dog who had bitten the person and having a human victim Eat the liver raw.Wait, what?I lost what we're talking about.Maybe is rabies how to get rid of it because they had no idea.They knew that it was coming from K9s They kind of got that so then you locate a puppy and just kill it.What?No, what year was this Jamie?They knew that it was coming from K9s.They kind of got that.So then you locate a puppy and just kill it?What?What year was this, Jamie?This, it doesn't say because it says we're the best.1982.Yeah.We're in the middle of like Romans, the Greeks.Wow.I think that's the best.I wonder if the dog thing worked.Like if you get some of the rabies virus through cooked meat.Burning hair picked from the tail of the dog and inserting the ashes into the wound.What?Whoa!This treatment lives on today in a name and spirit with the hair of the dog.Whoa!Hangover cures, which calls for alleviating blood and alcohol and due symptoms with more alcohol consumption.[2:00:00] Well, aren't we?Shit, that's what the hair of the dog comes from.That's wild.That's what the hair of the dog comes from that's wild.That's crazy He's like You get bit do me a favor you gotta just bite that thing eat it put some salt on the fataste But you gotta get in here you gotta salt up the meat.Who do you think you want to have salt on you like it would you know It's like but it's probably how they preserve it or something maybe I mean maybe they thought like salt is gonna kill salt it I mean that's how they preserved stuff yeah back then they'd cover meat with salt they'd cover everything like they had wars over salt like salt was a little like really important and now they get away for free yeah imagine being someone from the salt war days it's's all like the most.Yeah, and going into a restaurant You got a whole You fucking scene.Well, you just twist it whenever you want.Yeah, who the fuck is salt [2:01:00] Can imagine how they would freak out and trip them to salt bay like what Especially to get the steak cup in in gold like you fucking asshole.I love I've sold K get salt salt Salt Bay gets videos.Ah, let me villageers.I had a slaughter to get that much gold.Yeah, fuckers wrong with you animal That's it.They lost the thread on how they got it this guy wrote a book early 19th century on causes of rabies.Ooh, this is an interesting one when you get to like the fourth cause.It says what the Bite of a Wrapped Animal was named first.It was picked, it was quickly followed up by a cold night air eating beach nuts, a fall, and the involuntary association of ideas.Can I have some more of the weed that we were smoking just because I need to understand that?Yeah, yeah.I don't know what that means.This guy was smart and bright for his times, but it's like just proof that they didn't know what rabies was.Thank you.What does that mean?So you don't know what it means either?In voluntary association of ideas can cause rabies?To give this guy credit, he is the, I think, one of the first people to accurately describe it as a disease of the nervous system, as opposed to bloodborne.[2:02:09] What do you think that means?An involuntary association of ideas.What does that mean?Isn't that just life?Involuntary association.Like someone can get some wild ideas in your head and those can cause rabies.Is that what it means?No, it's taking rabies and see if anything comes up.Did you want me to do this?That's right.That seems so ridiculous.It seems so ridiculous.I didn't really understand what the sentence meant.What does that mean?Clinical features of rabies patients with abnormal sexual behaviors as the presenting manifestations abnormal sexual so the rabies wants to be transmitted sexually.Yeah, what does abnormal sexual behavior mean?32 year old man with frequent ejaculation as the initial symptom of rabies was first reported.[2:03:01] Wow, I guess that's a fucking catch.Stop, wow, stop.I know a lot of guys with rabies, then.Then a literature review was conducted using databases, including CNKI, Sinomed, VIP, Wangfang, Data, Science, Direct, ProQuest, Ovid, and PubMed in addition to our case.54 other rabies cases with abnormal sexual behaviors are the presenting manifestations Have been reported since 1970 among 55 cases 51 were male, DERR, and three were female Unknown gender for one case.Oh God Even back then with ages ranging from six to 71 years.Wow.All cases were reported in developing countries.46 in China, dog bites were the major source of infection, and extremities were the main exposure sites.Wow.That's crazy.83%, 83.6% cases had abnormal sexual behaviors as the initial symptoms.[2:04:01] The major presenting manifestations were, what does that word, pre-apism?Was that word, pre-apism?Was that mean, pre-apism?Am I reading this right?You get bit by a dog in China and you just thought it just started.I'm starting it.It's common.There you go.Rare condition, a prolonged erection of the penis, that's right.The full or partial erection continues hours behind.It is caused by sexual stimulation.So that's what this is.This is like, there's so wild and randy that they have a constant heart on and ejaculation in males and hypersexuality and females.All cases were clinically diagnosed based on medical history and clinical manifestations, given no standardized post-exposure prophylaxis.All cases died With the survival time between one and 15 days.Yeah, most people who get rabies die Do you think that that just had rabies in it?Like a you can let's hope make story more fun.All right.Let me take out the rabie part of it Right, just you catch that you get something where you have that disease [2:05:01] You got the heart on you can't get rid of you just keep ejaculating ejaculating is fun where you have that disease.You have the heart on you can't get rid of you, just keep ejaculating.Ejectulating is fun.How long before it's not, is it like in 20 minutes, you don't like it anymore?A couple of days, like if you're just constantly feeling the feeling of ejaculation, is it like can you perform your regular tasks?It's another level of health, just like that fucking head getting sewn back on the body.It's hell, right?This is your, this is constantly hard and like in 20 minutes.20 minutes is so, yeah.You're exhausted and you just keep coming.You like can't stop me.21 minutes, I can't take this anymore.Yeah, imagine like never not being horny.That would be hell.What is this guy?He's got it?He has 100 orgasms a day.Oh Okay, well there you go.Yeah, and zero friends I was like he was having a blast faking it.He's got rabies.He's faking it He's not nobody comes that hard after 199 There's a hundred orgasms day.That's a hundredth one.He's [2:06:02] No way if you've ever gizzed more than three times in a day, the third one is dust.The third one is just a promise of future gizz.So that's 97 blanks.All right, actually, yeah.Yeah, that's crazy.Yeah.That this person came out as transgender and suffers from persistent, general arousal syndrome.Is that the thing?Mm.And what's, is there a cure?Yeah, but I mean prove it, bitch.You got your pants on.That's an H on not from there from being honest.Yeah, that's an H on not from there.I want you to really show us, we're just gonna give you and keep you in an aquarium.And really show us that you're always hard and this isn't just an act for attention.Yeah.You might be kooky.You always gotta throw that in, but anytime you add some gender thing into any kind of possibility of someone being kooky, everybody, oh, I can't do that.It's genders and vans.You surfs it.Genders just like, whoo, wipes the sweet clean.Yeah.What a time.What a time, Salvador.[2:07:00] What a time.I can't imagine that.So let's say he does have it.What is his life for real?It just nuttin' all time, constant nuttin'.But he's had enough time to call the news.I'm just, come watch me come.Yeah, he's a freak, guys a freak.But it's just my 30th or time with the day.Oh, I mean, you have to document these things if you're a journalist otherwise what are you doing right why are you there?But so he can he not work can he not be in a relationship?Can you not work any money?What did you take money from the government?I can't stop coming home coming out.I'm coming out.Does he go to Easter with the family like what is he oh my god?It's really he's really sitting there just orgasmic is that real?Why was last time you bet over like like that when you came for the 80th time of the day?It's just no dehydrated.Yeah, kids fun.I mean while he's losing weight like a pro wrestler.Space was purple.That's gotta be.The old things not that pressure.You're spending too much time on this.Yes.I think he's full of shit.I'm just guessing.I mean, look, if you really does suffer from that, you gotta imagine, like, imagine a suffer from it, no one believes you.[2:08:07] You're right, I have to take it back and I apologize.Cause a match, because you gotta imagine some people are definitely hornier than other people.Some people are actually asexual, they're like, you can keep it.I don't want it, K-Bit.Back to our rabies case, it says that this happened to someone up to 40 or 50 times a day by the fourth day.Oh my god.32 year old Chinese men began to have frequent ejaculations.How are they coming out, buddy?They just shoot now, are you touching your dick?Like what does that mean?Frequent ejaculation sound like you're passing the buck.Do you ever help one along?We're hit all so loud.He's being off with all hands free.He walks fucking zoom monkey.He's like 45 or hands free, five were him.The wildest is the chimps at the zoo, just jacking off in front of the real estate.He's scared.He's just figured by any touch.Any touch.A-ya-ya-ya!Any touch.When frequent ejaculations increased to 40 to 50 times [2:09:00] on the morning of day four, the patient went to a local clinic 50 times a day this dude was not He's like maybe I need to get this look that Traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of imbalance of Yin and Yang you're telling me Right However a symptomatic treatment to rebalance the Yin and Yang had no effect crazy However, a symptomatic treatment to rebalance the Yin and Yang had no effect, crazy.In the same afternoon, he was sent to the community hospital Beijing with the following symptoms, headache, dizziness, nausea, malaise, fever of 39 degrees Celsius, irritability, tacky phrasia, speech difficulty, hyper-vacillation, hyper-salvation.He was subsequently transferred to a territory, was that that word tertiary tertiary hospital third hospital?Sorry in Beijing for further diagnosis and treatment but the etiology remained unidentified at around 10 pm a day four patient was sent to infectious disease department of P.King University [2:10:00] Third Hospital and there's transferred to emergency department due to tacky cardio and University Third Hospital and there's transfer to emergency department due to tachycardia and dysphemia.His complaints included high penis sensitivity, painful erections and ejaculations 40 times a day triggered by any touch or ejaculations without erection and release of the semen as well as headaches, nausea, chest conjection and fever.There's no significant improvement after fluid infusion, symptomatic treatment, other support therapies.No, this is how we're all gonna die, sounds.This is what's gonna happen.Someone's gonna hear about this and go, okay, so what you're saying is a little rabies is really good.What we need is an inert form of raises.What we need is a rabies vaccine that gives you just constant rock hard boners for guys who like to party.You know, when I went blue shoes not enough.Yeah, when you just want to be a different thing than a person.And you also don't want rabies.Well, we've got the imaginative like every guy starts doing it.[2:11:00] Just like how many women have fake boobs now?Quite a few.What if like most guys?It'll be like baseball.You got everyone's got to do it and if you want to compete.You got to get the rabie shot.Did you get your rabie shot?You're 16.You can get a rabie shot at 16.Doleless and Elz Robert Kennedy Jr.He posted, this is some fucking side effects.Get your rabie shot.Get your fucking dick You imagine if like something switched.What can I do it?Well, if you think of animals, so like tigers.Tigers can breed 50 times a day.When a female tiger's and the tiger just keeps fucking.They fuck to the...Is that what?Literally, is that where easy tiger comes from?I don't know what that term is.Either easy tiger.Oh, no.No, no.We just find out that they're here on the dogs.You might be right, maybe.But that's for a short period of time when the females in season.If she's not an estrus, he won't do that.But if a person has sex for fun, like if a person could be as horny as a tiger all the time, what a terrifying world we would live in.Someone's working on that.[2:12:01] That's what I'm worried about.If someone just said, look, there's certain medications that get created that are essentially performance enhancing medications that you can prescribe to people for stuff.You know, like when they first, I think this is true, ProVigil.I think the initial idea behind, check and see if this is true.I think the initial idea behind it was using it as a performance enhancing substance, but then they couldn't do that because you can't just prescribe something to help people, you have to have a sickness.And so they went with, I think it was insomnia.No, not insomnia.What's the other one?We just pass out.When you faint, what's that one, Jamie?We just narcolepsy.Narcolepsy, yeah.So I think they used it for narcolepsy.And if you ever taken ProVigil or NewVigil, it's a weird chemical.And I think Tim Ferris, when he wrote one of his books, he decided to not put it in there, [2:13:01] because he was worried that people would just eat it like candy if they knew how effective it was.Really?Yeah.And he and a lot of people were of the opinion that there's no such things as a biological free lunch.There's no such thing as one thing that turns on that much of your brain that's probably not doing something that we don't know about yet, you know.You could be like fucking something up long term like who knows.Let's get some studies done.But I've taken it before on trips.Like if I had to go somewhere, like say if I had to draw, like if I did a gig in San Diego and I had to drive back home to LA, the gig's done at like midnight, you know, we grab our shit, we throw it in the car, and it's two hours of driving.And if you're fucking tired at like one in the sleep, not happening.But not speedy, that's what's weird.Yeah, no, no, it doesn't increase your heart rate.It doesn't make you like a blabber mouth, you can't shut the fuck up, it's not like that.It's like a weird sort of like, like the idea of being sleepy just gets erased.Is it crash?[2:14:01] Is it crash?That's the problem, that's why I think Tim Ferris was worried about putting in the book.It doesn't seem to have much of a crash.Really?I didn't feel it.I mean, everybody's different.Did you sleep when you get home?Yeah, I slept.You also slept?Yeah.I went to bed when I got home, which is like two-ish, two I think I was like, maybe a half an hour later I was asleep.Wow.Yeah, it didn't stop me from sleeping, but it stopped me from falling asleep at the wheel or being drowsy at the wheel.You know those moments where the fucking road just starts hypnotizing you, the white lines, and you're just like, oh no.And you're literally like, what am I gonna do?Like, are we gonna pull over on my, I'm gonna push through this.It happens a lot for us, I'm driving a lot on the road all the time.My manager, Jeff, he gave me the best advice.It's the best advice.I do it every time I know I have to drive it, I'm tired.You get ice cold water and a rag, like a bath, like a, like washcloth.Sure.That's the best.If you have ice in the washcloth, that's the best and a little bit of water and put it Just get a little tougher worth thing of ice and water in a washcloth and when you feel tired [2:15:10] You just take that washcloth you rub your face real quick.It goes away really?goes away and then five minutes later you might need it again But you got it right there you rub it in your face goes away What happens if you don't like it gets you need the ice is the fact there is not the cold water.Yeah the cold water wakes your face right up and it works.It just stimulates.It does whatever it has to do just to snap you out of this cycle of droning and just people fall I can't I want to high school with fell asleep behind the wheel died.It happens.Me too.Actually.My friend Tommy had an accident where he blacked out on the wheel and crashed his car.Yeah, I think about this Often now because my parents they live in a different state and it's like it was only like 75 minutes away But they come to visit me and then when they can't we both visit you and then they go home and I'm like I'm just getting Yeah, recently my mom told me she's like I [2:16:10] I don't want it.I had to get a Coca-Cola something because I get sometimes I start to fall asleep and I'm like, what?I'm like, don't, don't, don't make the drive.Yeah, don't be.She's like, no, be all right.I'm like, but you don't know that you will.Like I couldn't believe she told me that like she sometimes like does a little it's like mom.Jesus.You know, so she's that bitch on the pilot.She's like 70, like four.She asked me for a mountain bike.Fits Christmas.So here does it enhances cognition too.The drug metaphenol was developed to treat narcolepsy, kind of, excessive sleeping, but it's widely used off license as a smart drug to promote cognitive enhancement, where quality such as alertness and concentration are desired to assist someone with, for example, exam preparation, I bet they give that shit to fighter pilots too.Do you imagine?I, you need a laser, I mean, the focus that's required is like, like, like, humanly.They don't, I don't think they think about laws.Like, whatever the fuck is the best thing for them.[2:17:03] Yeah.Give them that.What are we stupid?Someone's written down on paper, you can't give him that.Give him with a fuck he wants.He's flying, oh god, damn, fighter jet.You want those dude?Tune the fuck in.You don't want him sober.You want him on whatever, adderol, whatever, whatever the fuck in mixture is.That stuff and adderall together just like just fucking load them up.Discipline.Pumble them up.Yeah, discipline fighter jet pilot with a little bit of Adderall, a little bit of that stuff, just locked and fucking loaded.Just in there.You don't want any distractions.You want a hyper focus.It's your ass.What do you think of a fighter pilot's like regimen?Do you think they keep a certain regimen or something?They're very fit.At least the blue angels are.I flew with the blue angels once.And the dude that flew with me was jacked.He was fucking you.And he was telling me that you really need to be physically strong to over, because they don't wear a G suit.They just use this method called hooking to like, go like this hooch hooch hooch so as the G's are hitting you you're forcing blood into your brain.[2:18:08] It's dangerous.Yeah and you you have to be strong to do it so like you go where the blue angels are they have weights all over the fucking place.These guys are always working out.But I'm thinking cognitive.What about cognitive?Oh you have to be a fucking genius.But they have to have a routine though where they they keep themselves sharp right?I mean like that's part of probably their daily lifestyle.I'm sure there's constant assessments.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.I'm sure I'm sure there's probably like a lot of drug testing.There's probably making sure you're getting sleep.I mean, they're putting you at the helm of something that caught one of those things cost like what is a what is an F a 18 cost?Yeah.let's take a guess.Is it a hundred million dollars?I would have, I would have, I would have, what are one of those things cost?300 million?What is like our top?But that's it that's fully loaded.What's our top of the food chain jet right now?Like what's the best jet the Americans have?Cause the one I flew in I believe was an F.A.18 with the blue angels.It was insane.Yeah, it's insane.They wanted to put us in one of those.I didn't do it.It's going through the fucking canyon.He's like, you're like, you [2:19:10] know, like, we're gonna couple hundred feet off the ground.Yeah, I did throw up.We put the guy in the show on one and he went and he went out and he had all the stuff and they said, this is what's gonna happen.You're probably to get nauseous and throw up and black out.And that's exactly what happened.And we had all the cameras in it.And when he got back, we couldn't see it.Like we couldn't see him.So he just took off of the thing and there was cameras in there.And then when he came back, we were going to just be like, how to go?Because we, and he came back, he got a thing open.He looked like absolutely horrified, ill, sick, like, trump traumatic.He threw up, he passed out, he woke up, he threw up, he passed out, he came out, he was crying, and he goes, that wasn't, because the guy was just like, merciful with him.Oh, boy.And he was like, it's not funny.I'm not, we shouldn't have been I ain't even gonna put out an air.Did they teach him how to, like, keep his consciousness?to do the hooking thing.Yeah, he got a little, he got the briefing, you know?I got it through the heart part.[2:20:06] And then I got cocky and another part and I didn't do it quick enough and I blacked out.The part that I blacked out in was way less G's.The part that I didn't black out was like seven G's, which was crazy.And then I think the one I blacked out was like four or four and a half, I blacked out.I just did it in a hooking time.I just wasn't sure if I should be doing it now, like when to do it.And the pilot, when you hear the pilot hooking, that's what's really scary.I hear him going, hoot hoot.I'm like, oh, shit, he's blackin' out too.Like he's experiencing, when I'm experiencing.Those fucking dudes.Those dudes are American.Like if you want the rest of the world to be worried about America, you want to be worried about pilot pilot guys.Real American men.What did you see?They need a fucking pilot to cut, shit.What did you see in there, though?What did I see?What do you mean?Like you're sitting in the jet, right?I mean, behind him.So I'm seated.Can you see?[2:21:06] Oh, yeah, I can see everything.Oh, you could.Oh, yeah, this fucking glass around you, man.You see it.No, no, see it up, right?But so I'm just thinking, you're just looking into it.Do you have any sense of scale?Are you looking, you don't see anything?You're just seeing blue Like we did a flip where you do the thing all the way around we did that so but he's but he's also going through the canyons at low Out to oh like in top gun too.Oh, yeah.Oh shit.No way you did that.Oh, we did that.Yeah You was that just let's do it or did you have to get yourself there to get in that?I mean I said whatever he wants to do.I'm gonna do that's the thing they do yeah They take you on this run.They like to have a route.They take you.I don't trust it.Well, these are the crazy ones when they fly next to each other like fuck all that.Yeah, fuck all that in the canyon.My friend Mark Smith does that.He did that with the Thunderbirds.He's a referee for the UFC.[2:22:00] You have to be an exceptional human being to be able to pilot one of those things.I mean, you have to be on your fucking peas and cues.Yeah, like superhuman basically.Yeah, yeah.What was that jet you were showing us that just lifts up off the ground?The F-35.That's hard.Top of the food chain.No, at least that could be null above.Within 10% of the right guess.109 million per aircraft.Show a video of that thing.That thing is nuts, man.This thing is nuts.Watch how this motherfucker takes off.First of all, it looks badass.You see that thing coming at you?You're like, oh, we should've signed a treaty.That fucking look how it takes off.Look how it points down at the ground.Look at its asshole.a tux.They're gonna take a shit on you right now.It asshole tux down on the ground.Oh, that's sick.Look at that, that's insane, dude.That is literally insane.Yeah.The asshole tux at the ground, and it just lifts up in the sky.This looks fake.This is real.That looks like like the lunar orbiter getting pulled from the surface of the moon by special effects.That's wild.Look at that thing.Oh, and that's how it lands as well, bro.[2:23:06] Are you fucking kidding me?That's insane.That's the thing.That's what it was 10 years ago.So this is not.Oh, yeah.Now it goes like the speed of light.That's invisible.The old model.Yeah, that's so funny.That's like an iPhone one today, what the fuck is that?Right?Like 10 years ago in Jets, we're all the money.That thing has a cigarette lighter in any academy?With all the money that these dudes have to make these fucking things?I mean, I guess they're just limited by physics, right?They're just limited by propulsion systems and the metal and the G-force and the pilot being able to stay conscious.Take the pilot out, we can do better shit.100%.They're addicted to that.They're addicted to this, right?I would imagine you would be addicted to it.I mean, what kind of car do you drive?BMW SUV.They're nice.[2:24:00] That's a nice car.Don't you enjoy driving it?Yeah, I do.It's enjoyable, right?If you're listening to BMW, I like to get in a car and I like to go, oh, it feels good to drive.It's enjoyable.Imagine flying the fucking thing.You ever been on a racetrack?Yeah.Oh, yeah.I went to the Indy 500.Bank turn.Look at this fucking turn.That is so insane.It's just so insane that these things can do this.Look at how it just like hovers.Like that's a nutty craft.That thing's nuts.Yeah, it's like, it's so agile.It looks like a bird.I wonder how long it stays in the sky though.I bet it ain't long.I mean, where's all the gas?That must be eaten gas, you know?Like I have a ram truck DRX gets like nine miles of the guy.Imagine what that gets.Yeah, really?Yeah, yeah.Imagine what that gets.I mean, how, I mean, you just feel nothing.It's probably got a 25 gallon giant cast tank.Giant cast tank.That's so much.How much of a fill up?I don't know.You don't get to eat on that thing, not right?You get to eat.Yeah.You have a reserve tank, right?No.I don't.[2:25:05] Oh, my dad had a reserve tank in his pickup.Yeah.A whole second tank.Oh, that's a dude worried about the future.No, this is your trapper.That was a dude that got a lease at the right day.Oh, that's it.Yeah, well they do that is probably the most popular pickup truck in the world.I think it is probably next to the Toyota's Toyota Tacoma might be number one.Like what's the most popular pickup truck in the world?It's either an F-150 or it's a Tacoma.I think my head, it's an F-150 is a name I always, always, always have heard you can't go wrong with it.Yeah.They've been making those things just like Porsche 911s.They've been making that same truck from the beginning of time.Yeah.Just making it better every year.Ford F-150s of this shit.They're so durable.My dad had him even growing up.Like we had him.They're fucking great.Is that the number one?48 years in a row.That's it.That's it.Ford F series most popular truck best selling truck in the US.It's been that way for nearly half a century and they fucking deserve it.[2:26:08] They're amazing trucks.And now that you say it, I think they say that in the commercial all the time.It's like, I just have one.I just have a Raptor.The most recent version, the six cylinder one.It was fucking great.Yeah.Great truck man.32 inch television.No, no flat screen.That's the only thing that sucked.Yeah.I Feel like if you're in that plane you need a 60-inch flat screen.Yeah, we need to reorganize my room I want to be in a theater.I'm in the sky on a spaceship.I don't know what the bullshit asked 30 32 inches is like that big It should look like cribs.That's not that big.Yeah 32 inches is not big.That's like the first flat screen.Do you think I don't know how to count numbers?32's not big.What is that?20,000 pounds of fuel.20,000 pounds of internal fuel has a range of greater than 1,200 Newton meters.I don't know.It was about a thousand miles.It says it can fly for like two hours without needing [2:27:01] refueling.Two hours.But they can refuel it in the air so they can stay up forever, essentially.The point is like when they're on the gas though, I bet it really fucking burns fuel.My point is my truck.My truck when I'm on the gas.Yeah.Oh yeah.It burns fuel.It's a little gauge on the TRX that shows you if you're running out of gas.Yeah, it shows you what like your gas mileage as you leave it on just cry Balance an hour when using the afterburner.I want to see a mid flight refueling is that I remember on Yeah, do you play like original intent?No top gun on original intent?You had to refuel is one of the things I'd do in between the to refuel in the air and I was like they really do do that That's insane.It's insane.That's insane.Again, like those level of human beings that can pilot those things and keep the shit together like this, fly in two jets right over each other like that.Like what, entrusting the guy in the bottom to stay still.Like, shut the fuck up man, this is nuts.And you got gasoline![2:28:01] You're pumping gasoline with your robot dick into the vagina of this thing.Look at it.Clamps up.That's nuts, dude.See how it like clamped in place?Because if it doesn't clamp, then you got gas brain all over your fucking jet engines and are hot as shit.I'm more impressed with the thing that has the gas in it actually.Yeah, the dick.That was made second, you know?Like that's newer technology than the jet itself.It's all nuts, dude.I mean, just the fact that they have this thing as nuts.Look at it.And it's really kind of weird that it takes war for us to make something that's that cool.Right.Like that amazing to look, like if you're a guy, like what a guy, what do guys love?Fast cars, we love spaceships, rocket ships.I know a lot of girls too too.Don't get me wrong, but men generally design these things.The ultimate is that.You only get that if you go to war.You got to kill people to get that.The best of the best of the best minds and the best of the best of the best people that [2:29:04] can pilot that thing Ultra for my war like if Bayes house goes out.I mean Bayes house is like 200 billion dollars because I want a fucking fighter jet Man if you sit around with a super hot girlfriend with a shirt on button to the neighbor So you know what I want?I want a fucking fighter jet.He can't even have a fighter jet.That's bullshit You can have the biggest yacht in the world.You can have the most beautiful wife.You can have the fleet of Rolls Royces.No fighter jet.Fighter jet is only for people who get to kill people.Yeah, that's good.You can have a gun.We can let you have a gun.You can have a rifle.You can have a shotgun.If you want a short barrel shotgun you gotta get a tax damp and get a go through the government but if you want a pistol you know you can get a pistol but no no fighter jet not a fighter jet you can have a tanky there you can buy one shut the fuck up well they go that's a little bullshit that's only 79 grand you know why it's only seven grand because it's only gonna last for one flight not a real plane [2:30:02] I'm like I didn't have a you You buy them?Yeah.Oh my God.That's a jet.Now, million dollars.But you're not allowed to buy that new one.What?Well, right?If you talked to Lockheed and you have enough money.Do you think they would sell you one of those jets?Do you think I'm putting this in Jeff Bezos' zero right now?with the government to not sell them the same stuff that they're selling the government, but they might be able to make you a slightly different.So these are like 1990 ones.Scroll up a little bit.That one was like above that.1992.But I think that's a propeller.Think of the market that you're selling to.Like look at that one.Those are good jet.They're Illinois.But no one's buying that unless they're a pilot right?I mean, or how small is a demographic that could possibly buy?I believe you could buy these.Now they have to be unarmed right?They have to take well helicopter stuff right?Oh my god you buy a black one.How much is really?How much is the buy car?It's a premium listing call for price.They don't list it.[2:31:03] Translate this into rubles.They don't list it like listen to the price they're gonna shock me.Yeah.It's 110 grand.Hello, I am calling from Illinois.I seek to buy on the open up.I want to know for sure how much for just my children love black walk down.I thought the fun thing.Buy a black arc.Okay, you buy a 92 jet for $3 million, $3,200 in Redondo Beach, California.Look, it's got dope camo on it too.Like if you get a fight smurf's, you can blend in with them.How inferior do you think that model is to a current model?That would have to be crazy inferior, but still insanely cool.But do you think you actually get those missiles?No.I want a missile.Oh, doubt it.What was that?I'll talk to my manager.I'll talk to my manager.Did you see that, the Netflix thing?It was Project Odessa, right?Where this fucking dude was a drug runner, and he bought a sub from the Russians, [2:32:01] and they asked him if he wanted to buy nuclear missiles too.Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.And this is like at the fall of the Soviet Union.Right, right, right.Did he?I don't think he did.No, it just was an Netflix.Yes.I watch a lot of stuff high and I think it rings a bell.It rings a bell.Yeah, operation of desks.Operation of desks.It's fucking amazing.That's crazy.That's the sub, they sold them a sub.Wow, that's crazy.That's crazy.But the documentary's amazing, because it's all real, but it seems like a plot of like a guy Richie moves.Yeah.It's so nuts, it's so nuts.A sub, that's even, I wonder, you know what?I wonder if a sub, like, can almost go on order.Do you, what level of pilot do you have to be to drive a sub, you think?It's a good question.It's probably really hard because you have to do all by instrumentation, right?Because like, what do you, you imagine how terrifying must be if you're in a place that you know there's rocks under the water and you drive around with this tube compressed by a thousand feet of water.Just hoping you don know bang into something.Yeah, hoping you're all your fucking sensors work correctly.Yeah [2:33:07] Down there I wouldn't get in one what the fuck dude But I mean like actually like actually piloting it.I know that the reading instrumentation So that's a lot of stuff, but like I wonder what it's actually like to like is he just like oh I'm just back you know like I would imagine and that?And now they must have so many, they probably were such a real, educated sensors, you know, the big theory about all this stuff is that we have sensors in the ocean and they're all over the place and that our government and our military set them up there and that they knew when that submarine with all those rich people clopped and imploded, they knew that when that happened, they knew exactly when that happened.So all that shit about still looking for the people, it was all bullshit.They knew those people were dead.But then so then they released the fact that they had recorded this explosion that happened in the same area.This failed each other.But the real conspiracy is they don't think that they have those things under the water to detect submarines [2:34:07] That they have those things under the water for UFOs and that a lot of the The activity that we're seeing with all this UFO UAP stuff as things that are coming in and out of the water That's why they're always near the water.I haven't heard that.Yeah, that's the wildest one You know like what the governments underwater one.You know, like what the government's underwaters searching?They have a like a mansion.There's a top secret program that's setting up these underwater detection systems and listening systems and video taping things because things are going in and out of the ocean.I see you have to figure out like where's their insertion point where can we set up and Then just like setting up these monitoring stations try to figure out what the fuck is going on down there There's a place we can't even go and there's a whole little village in these motherfuckers [2:35:02] Space ships shooting out of the bottom of the ocean and half into the sky.I have enough Problems on my mind already.I don't need this one.I mean, if they wanted to hide and play inside, that's the place to do it.Hide right in the ocean.Have you watched Sugar?What sugar?It's a new show called Farrell on Apple TV.Oh, I saw the preview of that the other day is good.Yeah, I've been watching it.And it's like, I didn't know where it was going.And then it takes a real sharp turn.And what you kind of thought you were watching, you realized that maybe you weren't.It's like, I can give it away.But yeah, I was gonna say, if you get it, I'd say, you're already fucked it up.Now I'm gonna be looking for that sharp turn.You'll never see it though.So don't worry.Okay, good.Yeah, don't even I was in what we talking like what we talk about Don sir rabies you think that alien that they feel that alien matter They cop to like a few months back is is real because back then I thought it was now people saying it's bullshit What do you mean when they felt they they that alien like they showed the alien that they found?[2:36:01] Oh, what is this when did I miss this one?one the government came out and said that they we they literally made a statement saying we have alien matter but like matter like actually what crush said about biologics i think is what you know you're talking about the whistleblower who got in front of was it congress yeah yeah see those things are interesting because it's all just talk until they could show you something but they showed something uh oh didn't they know there's no bodies they have something around the same time than that story hit of the down on the tunnel excuse me not only the vagus yeah the vagus story but like the mex mummy that they had, that was like that little tiny thing.Yeah, but that was bullshit.I know, but I'm saying they don't like it.Yeah.Is the Vegas story the backyard with the kid calls me so I'm staring at something that he gets frozen like in his place?Yeah, and there's like some image in the backyard that you can see not it's fake, run through AI rather.And they don't think it's fake, but it doesn't mean that it's not like a dude in a costume or something.[2:37:08] You're just hanging out your backyard in the aliens, just happen to land there real quick and take off.That one hit me.I was following up for days and they didn't like follow up with them.Well, the family's probably undocumented because it seems like some of them at least are probably not documented.They weren't speaking English, right?Wasn't that the case?No, I mean the kid was because he called 911.They play the call.Am I thinking of the same one?Yeah.Thank you.But was there a bunch of people that were speaking Spanish?Cops that are different one.Maybe they don't want the attention because then people were showing up at their house.Maybe they really legitimately did see it and they got freaked out.Who fucking knows, man?But if individual things that happened like that, if it did happen, nobody would fucking believe you, just like a ghost story.If you went out to let your dog out, you're like, come on buddy, gotta take a leak.You take him outside, and you stare an eye to eye [2:38:01] with this four foot tall creature with giant black eyes and it's standing in front of this like transparent glowing orb that it just stepped out of and you're sitting there going what the fuck yeah and you're now crazy and then it gets back into that thing and shoo yeah and disappears into the cosmos and you're like what the fuck man yeah and who do you even tell if you you tell me, I'll go, okay.What does that stuff you said you were taking?Yeah.How much do you take?That's what it is.That's what it was.What was yesterday like?That person would be deemed crazy.Stressed out.Proud with your lady.What's going on?Yeah.You're seeing things.But a thing that's just uncommon, but happens.That's got to be that would be the wildest one of all of all the possibilities of all the things that it could be the wildest one would it it would be.This is an actual life form that occasionally visits.Yeah.I saw something I didn't know what it was once I was driving at night on the highway.Was it a vagina?You got me.What was it?Where were you?[2:39:11] I don't know.I was like driving home from a show, but I wasn't far from home.Maybe less than two hours away.I know that.I saw the sky, I mean, a flat, not didn't light up, like a flesh of light that lit up the sky, but it came from like as far as my eyes could think, believe that the distance of my eyes could see.It was, it came like, it was really far away.I was like, what was that?And then in like a fraction of a second later, it flashed again and it was half the distance.And then one more time, like, I mean, one second later, flash, and the flash was where I was, and then there was no more flashes after that.Wow.And my girlfriend was in the passenger seat but she was sleeping and I woke her right up after that.I was actually was looking around at other cars even was gonna pull over and say, [2:40:00] did you just see what I just saw?But nobody really stopped, I didn't stop either.But I can't explain it.It's how long it goes.I would say maybe a little less than 10 years, seven, eight years ago, maybe.Yeah, I can't explain it.I know what it's not.I know I wasn't seeing things.It wasn't like, oh, there was a building or this light flash.It was distinct.It was something I hadn't seen before, like the way that the light came.I think it's probably some kid on some planet somewhere with a drone, it's having a good old time.Like a laser guy.It's probably doing a reality TV show for true TV, an Alpha Centauri.I mean, imagine, if like what we're seeing is just like kids' toys.Enough people say, yeah, right?Kids' toys.Enough people say, yeah, right?Kids' toys.No one even cares about what the humans are doing, but kids do.Sometimes kids will sit on a drone down here, check it out.You know?It's so possible.It's so possible.It's also possible the more time goes on, the more I look at those little grays, I'm like, why are we even assuming those things are alive?Like we're the gray aliens.Why are we even assuming those things aren't some [2:41:06] robot?Like we're real close to making robots, like super duper close.And why would you risk sending a person or a living thing across the galaxy at a fucking billion miles an hour when you guys just use a little robot people?Really good now.Like giant heads, they don't talk, they can't fuck.And you get these little robot guys to go and collect sperm samples from people and fucking take them up into the spaceship and run experiments on them and then drop them back off.Yeah.Maybe they're all robots.That could be true too.Yeah, that could be the future of intelligence species.They all become some sort of electronic thing.Yeah, that could be, that's, that sounds terrible for us, but if you were being objective, you go, I could see how that, that could be possible.I, uh, I get, if I start thinking about this stuff, like, you know, if I can't sleep or something, I start thinking about this stuff.[2:42:01] I, I, I, I mean, I'm in the age right now where I'm having that full on existential thing happening.Like, never happened before, but it's all the time now.I'm just like, what is going on here?Yeah, that's most people's lives.That's how most people think.Just like, it's weird.Just wondering what the future will be and just be like, I can't, someone will be around to see it.Someone in our lineage will be and just be like I can't someone be around to see it someone in our lineage will be around to see hopefully yeah or not Yeah, that's the thing eventually it's gonna be not the mean everyone wants to look at you know look at big picture But really look at big picture like this sun is gonna wipe us out We're not gonna make it we're gonna get to a certain point whether it's a billion years from now or whatever They think it's gonna be where the earth is no longer habitable.Right.That's just gonna happen.So, when we're like, oh God, that's so far away.Well, it's those 100 years, because you're not gonna make it to that either.Right.So, let's fucking, we got now.We're in a good spot now.We're in a good spot right now.I'm really, I'm nervous about the AI.[2:43:06] I really am.And so I just feel like this could be the precipice of the next, like just the next, you know, what life becomes.Not just the next thing, but who takes advantage of it and how?Right.It's like this newfound power.It's gonna be so different than anything else you've ever experienced before and who who's in control of it And it's the second most feeling of unsafeless besides war It's been it's up there with war you know, it's like you feel Unsafe right now like I'm unsafe, but not on I feel unsafe like in my lifetime unsafe, you know I don't know.Yeah, it's it's very different than anything that's ever happened before Because within a short amount of time, it's gonna be a real problem.It's gonna be a real thing that's smarter than us.We're not gonna be the smartest thing.Now, if we just stop right now, pull the plug, who knows?Maybe we'll be okay.We might not be okay if this thing keeps going.Or we might be, maybe I'm wrong.[2:44:01] But it's like everyone says that.Everyone says that.But yeah, they still, I mean, they've been, I mean, they'll never stop.Well, I think the problem is the Chinese government and the Russian government are not gonna stop.And for us to stop right now would be very dangerous.Right.If they become the first, if China becomes the first to be able to utilize this incredible power and just do whatever the fuck they want, whenever the fuck they want, and then it gets better and better and better under the power of this thing.That's not acceptable either.But then the problem is it's attached to weapon systems.And if it's attached to weapon systems, and all it has is like, it has a desired outcome that it's trying to achieve, right?And this desired outcome.Yeah, it's not thinking about morals or ethics or how many people are gonna die and how many innocent people are gonna, what's the most effective way to ensure victory?And it's gonna just do that.And that's gonna be horrendous.[2:45:01] And if someone from another country decides to do that first, that could be a giant problem.Real quick, because all it would take is dismantling our grid.That's it.All it take with that and we're fucked.It's funny that there's no, because like them turning, everyone has, I know the theory of all the, it turns on us, even the people in positions that are racing to get this technology.Yeah, it's a doggy dog world out there, man.But it's like, yeah, that's it.I mean, it's either, I guess, don't be the one to get it or just, you know, in a way, this thing that could destroy everything, I mean, it's for protection.But if we don't keep doing it, we're unprotected.It's basically the same argument that we have when we create the nuclear bomb.Right.Same argument, right?We have to do it for the Nazis, too.The Nazis get this first, we're all fucked.Yeah, this is what I'm saying.War, it's like a nuclear bomb.Yeah.It feels like a ticking time bomb, it really does.I know.I mean, for whatever, everything you read, and it's like, oh, about.Any type of regulations and stuff.I did a podcast the other day about it.[2:46:07] I think part of the problem is they can't really be.There's no way they can know everything about everything.There's too many things going on in the world.If you want to ask them about cobalt mining and the Congo and also ask them about overfishing in the ocean and also ask them about the negative side effects of oil spills and also act them, what's going on with pharmaceutical drugs and what's, and there's no way any congressperson, yeah, gun control.There's no way.There's no fucking way.They're going to be in charge of all the end.What are your thoughts on the border?And also, what are your thoughts on, you know, what about seed oils?Oh, it's just plug and holds.Yeah,.Yeah, there's no fucking way you can be really well read on all those subjects and be objective.Yeah, so they can't keep up.They don't know what the fuck is going on and it's happening in all these super nerds are out there coding and banging away at it.And they're about to release chat GPT 5.0, [2:47:01] which is gonna be the craziest of all crazy ones.That's of all the ones that have happened before like each one of them is more insane than one before and chat GPT4 is pretty fucking insane and then 4.0 is pretty fucking insane and when 5 comes out 4.0 talks to like a girl.I have not interacted with it at all not one time So I don't really know I see people making images and stuff and, you know, I'll write a joke and then, you know, write me an email.I've seen that weird shit where it's like, no, but I love you.I saw like those stories that came out with like, it was, it felt ominous, you know, like what like changes, the emails or whatever.But like I haven't, I haven't really gone past that because I'm like, you know, but it feels like you have to, it feels like you actually have to.You were so off if you don't kind of get acclimated.I kind of get forced to pay attention to it because of this show and because of my friends, like Duncan, who's like really, really into it.Like Duncan uses AI all the time.Like if he was hanging out with you, he would take your voice bunch of stuff for AI to say like really embarrassing things and then he would say [2:48:08] So why'd you send me this and then we'll just start playing?Are you serious?Yeah, yeah, that's it.I mean, like they did it to Tony the other day.That's hilarious That's that's but that's ridiculous someone someone I saw in a forum was someone sent me someone took my voice and Made me and and made it the Michael Jackson bad album.So and they sent it out and it's it's my voice singing bad by Michael Jackson.But good, but it's my voice and it sounds like me to me.And I was like this is such a we are remember I was playing a dude in laundry I played I had played and I was like this is fucking nuts and that is gonna be a living thing Soon that's gonna be another cell that's gonna be another Bobby Lee that's gonna be whoever the fuck They want to make it you're gonna be able to make people That sound and look and behave exactly like that [2:49:02] We're gonna be able to bring Roddy danger field back from the dead and he's gonna go on tours or robot.I'd see it.I'd see it for sure.Yeah.I would.I just want to see what it's like.That'd be weird.Imagine you brought Lenny Bruce back from the dead, but you didn't let him write new material and he just bombed.Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I'm like, this is the guy we don't know to see him.And he's stuck in 1965.He still thinks he's like, hey, dig.Wow.You know.And he just gets like, hey.He's getting arrested for those jokes that people nowadays, they just like, now it's nonsense.That's my grandfather.Yeah, it's so easy.That's one of you.Yeah, because in the context of like his time, what do you say in his revolutionary?Like what is this guy saying?But it's hard for us to recognize that wasn't that long ago, man.Not even that whole way.It was like 60, 70 years ago.That guy was getting arrested for telling jokes and talking about certain things [2:50:03] on stage.It's hard to imagine that the society's changed that much in such a short amount of time.He said the 50s.Well, he was around in the 60s too.Like, when did he start getting arrested?Is the good question.I feel like it was, I remember, I remember, 60s I don't think so.He wouldn't be still getting arrested then.I think he died in the 60s.I think he died of a heroin overdose.Who's arrested the jazz workshop in San Francisco in 1961 for using sexually explicit language, although he was acquitted law enforcement agencies, put him under greater scrutiny, resulting in drug arrests in Philadelphia and Los Angeles.So they just started going after him.And he did do a lot of heroin, apparently.I think that's also how he died.I think he died from heroin.And I think he died in the middle of the trials.They were just constantly going after him.Wow.And the end it was really sad because there's some recordings of him on stage where he's [2:51:02] not even doing comedy.He's just reading from his legal papers and talking about his case.So people come see him and he would just like rant about his case.It was like sad.I have a bunch of it.You always see his albums in like the thrift stores and stuff.When you go to the record store, they use twins, they're always just a few bucks and there's so many of them.Yeah.I always swip everywhere on the road if there's a record so I'll swipe any comedy albums I can get.Whatever.Old, not this that.And they're always just like, there's the same ones you see that are like readily available all the time.Like they know no matter where you are.As I was like 10, you know, like rapping Rodneys.You know what I mean?You know, or that Eddie, that Eddie albums, I used to hear, you see the sunset strip, you see that everywhere.Oh yeah.But I got, I mean I get Pat Cooper, Alan King, and every, you know, you know, you know, I, what's his name?I'm Dick Gregory.Oh, okay.Yeah, Red Fox, it's, it's, come on, put him on, it's like, [2:52:00] you don't think to listen to these people and it's out there.You know, it's also like a time machine.Yeah.You get to peer into a time in the 1960s where someone's on stage and some comedy club in a different universe, like the world's different, everything's different then.Like the reality's different, it's the middle of the Vietnam war.Everything's different.They're on stage.You kind of hear it in the recording.It's like baked into it, it feels.You know what I mean?Whether it's just what you know, you're listening to or just the way they recorded it.Like I like, I actually really like listening to the crowds on the records as well.It's different.It sounds and feels different.Yeah, for sure.How they react and stuff.And I mean, their context, the civilization they lived in was just so different.It's so little access to information.The difference between people then and now is so vast in terms of how much we know about stuff, how much information we have about stuff.And back then, it was wild.That kind of comedy was only a few decades old.It was wild.[2:53:01] Nobody was doing it.There's a great series of recordings from Richard prior at Red Fox's comedy club in LA And I bought I bought them once at a gas station They just had them in like the cassette things You can buy them and they're fucking great man Yeah, and they're just these recordings of like Richard prior fuck it around making up material Working the crowd you hear like icing glasses.I'm never that exactly what I was talking about.That's the sort of thing I love.I love hearing it.Oh, it's so cool.Yeah, it's so cool.Klingin' and the Klingin' and the shaking and stuff.It gives like, it's like a, it's its own thing.It's like a, cut like you know.Yeah, it was like, I know.It was like, wow.I know, it's kind of weird.It's kind of weird seeing that.Yeah, well that was also George Carlin.George Carlin's only did early days.He was real clean cut and clean jokes.Oh, yeah, I haven't seen any of that.He wore a suit and a tie.Yeah, so you can find an early George Carlin.Yeah, you look at me like, no way.[2:54:06] That's the hippie guy.Yeah.Like no way.Yeah.I got to, I don't know his material though.I don't know what it was like.The early term.Very clean, very like regular comedy.Look at him.You have a stream of them for our entire lives and have noticed something holy shit.When the Westwins involved Indians, and sometimes they don't, sometimes it's Brian Donlevy with a black hat and a crooked card game, when they involved Indians, the big scene of us...That's the same eyebrow thing.When the Indians finally attacked the cowboys, we've been waiting for it throughout the entire movie, you can see them sitting in the hill.And that's the big scene when they finally get to them, and you always see exactly how the cowboys prepare for this attack.Now pull them wagons around the circle, get them all ready, something holding up the weapons, come on now, tear them up, panic, or choose from them, bandages, get that one up there, it's damn sad, damn it.Big hassle, we never see how the Indians prepare.That's their attack, right?[2:55:00] Now the Indians were good fighters just because they started in Massachusetts and wound up defending Malibu, doesn't mean they're good.We really didn't play the game with them.As I say, now, the Indians were good fighters and if this is so, they must have been well organized.There must have been a way to divide their men power.It wasn't just one old chief, many moon come chucked on, a lot of guys running.Get it.Not bad.Yeah.Interesting.Yeah.I mean, that premise was, you know, interesting, interesting premise.Yeah.See, I meet him, no, I'm, yes.I met him at the comedy store and I saw him perform a bunch of times live.Yeah.So I'm alive when I was a kid.When I was 21 when I first started doing stand-ups on live and New Hampshire and you bombed.Really?Oh, six, seven years later.Seven years later, look at him, dirty hippie.Found out about hippie pussy.Revolution.He's like, hey, I'm playing the game wrong.Yeah.Probably did a little acid.Like, what am I doing with this fucking stupid tie on?I mean that is a that is a coast to coast transformation right now real quick, too.Yeah, just a couple years two years [2:56:08] Yeah, like what did you look like five years ago pretty similar that was 65 to what I think it was August 31st 65 to March of 72 That's crazy I mean he's nearly unrecognizable.Yeah, he also looks way older like he yeah, that doesn't look like a seven-year-old That's all that I have to eat you out from the inside Yeah, he aged car, I guess yeah, that's pretty nuts one of the greats.Yeah, man Yeah, I mean without all those guys I mean that's what's really interesting about the art form.Without guys like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, just a few people.It's just a handful of people, Richard Pryor, handful of people.Red Fox.What would this be now?What would it be?It's kind of crazy.Rickles, I would put in that.Yeah, Rickles.Sure.Definitely.Rickles, right?Rickles is like the original roaster.Oh, the best.What an animal that guy I was I have a Photograph in my living room that he autographed to me right now [2:57:06] It's like if there's a fire it's the first thing That's amazing.He was awesome.Yeah, he was so nice.He was so kind to us animal on stage The tax with jokes is attacking people insane.Yeah, you know, and for the time and I got was a murderer Nobody was like him back then.I saw him live within the last five, six, seven years of his life.I saw him in Atlantic City, which was great.He came in from the back with the horns and everything.Before he even got to the stage, it was 20 minutes of insulting people.Before he got to the stage, it was great.It was amazing.Didn't hold back.And then I saw him again later, I've shown like two years before he died up at Westbury, Long Island.And he sat in a chair for this one, but he still did two hours.Wow.That's awesome.Yeah.That's awesome.And then I got to go backstage and it was like, freaking midnight.And he was with his wife and one of the couple.And he let me come in and spent like, you know, even the people come in like, you got to like, then helping him out like, you got waving him off and he like, talking to me for like, good 10 minutes.[2:58:06] Oh, that's great.Yeah.I know I wish I saw him live.As a few guys, I'm like, damn it, you know what I'm missing in my life.Shit.Yeah.So I can't listen live quite a few times.Oh wow.I saw him once live at Great Woods, which is like this outside concert area, and then I saw him live at this, I saw his career start to slump, like I saw it in real time.Even though I was still a huge Kenisan fan, the second time I saw him, I was at this shitty casino-y place.It wasn't that good, it wasn't packed, and then the third time was kind of the same thing We were a comic.Yeah, I was just starting out Maybe I wasn't a comic yet like maybe I was thinking about doing comedy it was pretty close It's like right maybe right before I did comedy [2:59:01] But he went from 86 where he was on top of the fucking world to like 88.It had already started to kind of fall apart.It was wild how quick it happened.Like you have this one amazing album and one amazing HBO special.And those two were like his best things ever.And then everything after that is just too much party in and below.Just got caught up in the life.And the material wasn't that well thought out anymore.He's just like, his brother wrote about it in his book.If you read Brother Sam, it's a fucking great book.Bill Kenneson wrote it.Really, if you're a fan of comics, a really good book.But just tells you how this fucking wild man, like how different he was.Just plummeted.How long was he at that height?You think just a few years.I think before he got discovered, like before Rodney, to like, so like, I bet like from everything that I've heard from people that were around back then, he came a monster.He came, he was already a monster from the beginning because he had been a tent revival preacher.So he was a tent revival preacher who knew how to do stand up.[3:00:11] Wow.I mean, what an advance.That's what an advantage.You know, I mean, it's like, like teaching a gymnast, jujitsu, like they're so strong already.They're so flexible.They have a giant advantage.I wonder if he, how long it took him to get to that voice of like screaming and stuff.I think he had it from the 10 revival days because there's recordings of him doing sermons and he would do it like that.It's like, I'm in the air and Jesus.It's like really powerful stuff and that's a form of show business clearly.Yeah.and he was really good at it.And so he I've never seen an old set from him.Really like that.You never seen an old set?No, I only seen him a trench coat guy Okay, but there's some that are online you could find on YouTube him with like a leather jacket on and a comb over It looks like shit.Wow.Before you start wearing the beret.Yeah, you just have a comb over You know, he wouldn't shave the head, couldn't give it.Right.Right.Right.Right.Right.Right.When he came in back that he bought, he wanted to be a rock and roll guy, too.[3:01:06] So he had long ass air and like a band-aid on.Yeah.He was ridiculous.So that was him in the early days.This is his last sermon.His last sermon.But he was, I want to hear in his songs.It's got to be, this got to be on the screen.Is it mostly songs?Here it goes.I feel like I have as much, I feel so grateful.You can't believe how grateful I feel towards the spirit of God what he's allowed me to be part of.And I know I wouldn't have had it without this church.Amen without these ministries that you see on this platform.Amen without your cells.Amen.[3:02:01] We've all played a part in each other's lives we've given to each other Amen so that was him just preaching it's so wild here that voice attached to that that context It's wild Hear him and he's here.I'm saying it's a mind fuck and by the bad things already don't blow going crazy Yeah, he was already can't send you, Kinesan was a wild fucking dude, man.He was a wild dude.Just threw him through.Got hit by a car when he was five years old.Me too.Maybe a four.Four years old.How bad?Not too bad.I was playing a frisbee with my dad and I went to the hospital but I didn't break anything or anything.You get knocked out.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.We were in a parking lot, 100% empty parking lot, like a VW post, like a veterans post near my house where you just play like, and we were just playing frisbee fully gated.We're the only two people in that thing, only two objects in the thing.[3:03:01] We were throwing us frisbee, and my dad's friend was walking down the block, so he went to the gate to talk to him, and I was little, I was like, except four.And he threw the Frisbee and it went like over there, and I went to go get it, and as I'm going, I see I was staging way again, pull in, it came around the back, so it's not even from the oh, it was still coming at me.And I get to the frisbee and I pick it up.I'll never forget this.I picked it up and I fumbled it and it dropped again.And I so vividly remember saying, do I try to pick this up again?Or do I get out of the way?Because I just remember thinking like, this person has to see me I'm the only object in front of him Oh my god, and I went to pick it up again, and that's I woke up when my dad was running and I was in his arms Yeah, but it wasn't bad.It wasn't it wasn't bad I I don't even know if I got in cost or anything like that you definitely are in cost Yeah, cold.Yeah, okay, yeah, so, that was that was it I got to sue I got five thousand bucks nice to sue and I couldn't touch it dollars 18 [3:04:12] Oh, yeah, it was like a trust I think I yeah with Remember it's like 12 5 when I got it That's what was left 12,500 oh, oh, oh, because the five got the, oh.Yeah, it was 14 years.I've spent 1200.No, no, 14 years of, I guess, you know, Jesus, I'm smoking.Oh, that's amazing.So all the interest.Interest there.Yeah.Well, I have a, I have a bachelor's in finance.I couldn't just think that word just now and you ain't going by a nice car something No, I didn't buy a nice car.I don't know where it went.I don't write money I already took the hit.I wish I knew where it went I wish I had a nice story to cap this fucking.I know right?I still have that the book they gave me it would they would go and you'd have to take it and they would [3:05:05] They put it under a stamp and it would, it would put the new price, the interest you made that month, the new price and it would add it, like it would aggregate it.It's a red like statin' island savings bank, like foldable thing.So I used to, all through those years, it's like pages and pages and pages of like, the interest that they want, I still have that.Yeah.The old days, when you go to the bank.Go to the bank, remember that?Yeah.Mom picked this up from school.The bank?You got checked, cashed.The bank was a knife through my heart dude, because our bank was so fucking slow.Every time she got slow.It was 40 minutes.They have no motivation to move quickly.40 minutes.How's your day?How's your day going?only the drive through.Oh, no.That's what I mean.That's even worse.You see the line.And when your car starts overheating, you're like, no, it always did.She had it.She had that car overheated.It was so explode.We used to drive down to the Jersey shore in the summer.We'd be in the back seat.Bench seats, everything, right?But just my mom, this thing's a fucking boat it was you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you looking back and it's shooting black smoke shooting out of the tailpipe and she [3:06:06] used to pull over pull over on the on the on the turn on the parkway open the hood white smoke pouring out of the hood stunk she just get the coolant from the trunk just pour the coolant in there and get it to be careful when you're opening up the radiator yeah and like literally just kind of alleviated the problem as we drove.But the worst part was like when she was like, pick us up and stuff and it would like backfire because it was like, it backfire, like if you drove it, it was gonna backfire.So like coming to school and stuff, my mom said, she didn't mean to embarrass me.Like coming to school and that thing backfiring.Yeah.Yeah, and end up the smoke blowing out and then like having to get just having to get in the car You know, I mean like everyone saw it, you know how many cars back then just fucking polluted everything they came in contact Black smoke came out of every car every car Before they came up with catalytic converters.It was a disaster.I I remember as a kid smelling the exhaust all the time all the time [3:07:04] It was a land of gas.It was like lowers your IQ.It was a normal smell to smell.It was.That's why we're so dumb.It's part of it.Yeah.Hey, thanks for being here, man.Appreciate it.It was a lot of fun.It was a lot of fun.We'll definitely do this again and tell everybody you're special.It's on YouTube.It's out right now.It's out right now.It's called Terrified.Just search my name on YouTube.And also today, my new tour went on sale.Everything's fine tour.We started the first like it's 30 cities.So it's SavileCannocomedy.com.Beautiful.All right, thank you, brother.Appreciate it.Lot of fun.Bye everybody.\",\n",
       " \"I think I've known you for 30 years.You know how crazy that this?31.Is it really?Yeah.Wow.I remember the day we met.Really?Baskin Robbins on Melrose.Really?Yeah.Do we meet at Baskin Robbins?Baskin Robbins on Melrose.Really?Yeah.Do we meet at Baskin Robbins?Baskin Robbins.I got one of those memories like the girl from Taxi.Oh, do you really?We got a mint chocolate chip, double scoop, and I had peanut butter and chocolate.I think you're making this up.Well, I think you're making this up.He's making this up.I was like, let's see all this guys.He's saying he's got a memory like the lady from Taxios like that.I couldn't even remember a name That lady's got a crazy memory she does she can tell you like dates in 1972 what day it was dude I bumped into it a sushi joint once and she reenacted the day I lost my virginity Unbelievable, wow she remembered it.Oh, she know I lost my virginity.So unbelievable.Wow.She remembered it.Oh, she know.It was her.It was her.Oh, really?She popped my chair.It was hot back in the day.She drove my taxi.Ooh.Yeah.She acted as your depot.Wait, what's your name?Mary Lou Retina?No.What is it?It's close.Mary Lou Iris Cornia Cornia Mary Lou Cornia.Where was her name?Retina she's a gymnast.That's the gymnast.What was her name?That's the deaf check.Yeah, that's the one that everybody had a pretend was really good at acting But she did win an Oscar didn't she?Mary Lou Hennor.Oh She did win an Oscar, didn't she?Mary Lou Henner.Oh, she did the tampon commercials.Did she?Yeah.And who better to do them than a Tumblr?They get guys to do them now.Yeah.It's a new world.Yeah.Yeah, there she is.Back in the day when she was on Taxi, she was hot.[2:02] But you can't ever lie to her.Yeah, she knows everything.You didn't, you, like, I didn't say that, like not only did you say that, you were wearing this.Yeah.Yeah, she just knows it all.Yeah, I'm believe a blow.That's probably a real issue in relationships.Well, you can't, you can never argue with her about who is right.She remembers it.Yeah, you Yeah.100%.You're, you got a foggy ass bullshit, normal human.Like, how good's your memory?My memory's not that good.Maybe she's an elephant.I don't think their memory's that good.They say they are.Yeah, but like shit that you would remember too.Right.Like how often you watch one of those nature shows and you see like elephants wandering around aimlessly and you know they're looking for their car.Because they can't remember where they parked.Idiots.My survival elephants can drive.That would be a real problem.How big would their fucking car be?How big would their roads have to be?Wow.If anybody else, any other animals, start developing electronics, I think we just kill [3:02] them.Yeah.I'm like, what the fuck are you doing over there?Like we wouldn't be cool with chips fascinating their own weapons if they started making guns If the chips start smelting iron Yeah, figure out ballistics.You see chips on the range.Yeah, you're like hey, hey, hey, only us.Yeah Well, this is not what planet of the apes is all about like similar they evolved to the point where Wasn't the new one like experiments Wasn't it like some kind of experiments Like they were they would do like back in the day was like a time machine thing like they went right like the really old ones Yeah, the first time machine and you go Forward in time and you realize like oh my god that apes are now humans Yeah, they landed so far in the future on earth.You know who wrote that one, Rod Serlick.Oh did it really?He was a twilight talking man.He was away out of his time with everything.Genius.So many good episodes.You go back to watch the twilight zones like no production value, no money for special effects, incredible show.[4:07] And that's what was part of their charm, but the music, everything worked.And if you look at a lot of modern day movies, they were predicated on those old shows.Like Chuckie, there's an old episode with Telly Savales.Taki Tina.Hi, I'm Taki Tina and I'm going to kill you.This was a doll, remember?Fast forward to Chuckie that demented red-headed, freckle-faced freak.Look at that.There she is, Taki Tina.You know my favorite one was to serve man.Oh yeah, it's a cookbook.Yeah.And then Julia Childs walks out of the UFO.Yeah, yeah.How are we everybody?We're gonna serve your children.What did the aliens look like on to serve, man?Oh, very bizarre.Yeah, they had giant bulbous heads.Yeah, there it is.Yeah, they look like her and monster without the hair.[5:01] Well, how bad does fucking make up is?You can see where you can glue your cheek.You can see everything is so shitty.Like you better than that in a high school musical.Speaking of human cook box, I have a buddy who just had a kid and he told me him and his wife made placenta smoothies.And I'm sitting here going, what if you love them?What if you love the taste you're on kid?And one day you're with Billy at the park, and you're just looking at him and you're like, you know, you start licking your lips, like he sure did taste good.And then cannibalism and he eat your own kid.I don't think it's actually eating your own kid.I think it's eating the nutrients that provide nourishment to the kid while it's in the womb.It's not, you're not eating the kid.The kid is separate from the placenta.It is?Yeah, the kid is natural.Oh, I thought it was covered.Like, you know when a gazelle drops its baby on the calahari and it like licks all that fill moth it, isn't that placenta?[6:06] Or is that just like a pastasauce?It's like carbonara.I think that is placenta right?I mean it probably must be.So isn't that what human kids have?Don't they have that like gazelle?But it's not the kid itself.It's the nutrients that the kid was consuming while they were in the, I believe, obviously I'm not a doctor.Yeah, look at this.This one's gonna drop it.They eat that.She about to drop.Boy, how vulnerable are they when they're giving birth?Oh, yeah.And half of those kids get snatched up immediately.Really?Yeah, some cats are wild dogs or something come run over and steal your baby and that's it.You carry that thing around inside of you for months.You love it more than anything in life.They'll protect it like, obviously they have this insane connection with that baby and then it gets snatched away by a cat.And literally doesn't get its first bleat out.Like it lifts its head, and then bonk.[7:02] Well that's one of the things that people have to be very aware about North America.What?Bears.What bears are doing to deer and moose the same thing.Like the half of the, like if you really love deer and moose and elk, I love them.Half of those animals babies got eaten by bears.Yeah.The like half of the babies that come out.Half.Half.Yeah like that.the like half of the babies that come out.Half.Half.Yeah, like, you know, it's a good thing in a good ecosystem.To call the herd.Yeah, well, it's just, it's not even just a call to herd.It's just to, that's how, that's what they're there for.Like, it's a system.We look at it like it's this beautiful thing because it is beautiful.You see these animals in the wild and nature, but what it is, it's a system.It's got a mathematical system.You have numbers.The amount of predators is based on the amount of prey and the amount of babies they have and the amount of babies that survive.Animals that have less babies don't survive as well.Animals that are bigger, [8:00] fight off the wolves better.It's like there's a whole system.The whole system and it trickles down right to the vegetation and the ecosystem.You know this, like if they remove the wolves, then the elk and caribou herds expand and they start eating all the growth on the river banks causing erosion, the river is flat.Now it just, so you have to have those predators.So I'm glad they're eating half and I'm gonna if they're listening eat three quarters if they were any half we would be overrun by by deer and yeah like you'd you'd have a situation where you have like a New Zealand where they have to fly over the hills and just gun them down moose and now they have the New Zealand New Zealand New Zealand's a wild place well Literally, but it's beautiful.So beautiful.Both.They got there in, I get the 1700s or something like that, maybe the 1800s, and these European settlers, these European explorers, like this place is so beautiful, but it doesn't have any things for us to kill.[9:00] Why don't we bring in a bunch of wild animals from Europe that we like to kill?And so they turned it into like a wild game safari park for hunting.Cheezoo.Yeah, so there's all these animals like stags and all these different kinds of deer, all these animals that are not supposed to be in New Zealand.They're everywhere.They're so overwhelmed.Like if you buy elk, like if you go to a restaurant and you buy elk tenderloin, okay.Most likely that elk is coming from New Zealand.No.Yeah.There's elk in New Zealand?A lot of elk in New Zealand.And it's probably, they probably are allowed to consider stag elk too.I don't think they, I don't, that's a good question.I don't know.They're so similar.They're such a similar animal.They probably taste exactly the same, the only LK have a cool sound, but stags have a really cool, stags sound like a lion.Have you ever heard a stag roar?Yeah, it's really fucking cool.And then when they mate, the male elks do that whistle.You know that sounds like a pickle.What a weird noise.[10:06] Yeah.Look at his penis growing up and down.Oh yeah, they jizzled over themselves.Wow.Well, I've seen elk do it where they just piss all over themselves while they're screaming.They're screaming.Elk's are even cooler.Give me an elk and elk bugle elk bugle.I think it's the coolest Sound world.Oh me bro if you didn't know if you didn't know if you were in the dark and you were in the In camping and you know elk bugle and you didn't know what that was you think oh my god.There's monsters out here.Yeah Yeah, there it is.Couldn't you imagine that being a monster?Yeah.It's sort of like an instrument.Imagine if it's dark out, you hear that?You're like, fuck!It's demons!Yeah, that's what kind of haunting and scary.[11:05] That's the greatest animal.And then they go and do the big cats go into a flamin'.You know this?Flamin'.I ran into problems with girlfriends because of this.It's like when the female lions are the leopards, they get ripe, you know what I mean?Ready to party?Let's go.The lions and the cheetahs, they do this thing where they smell the female scent and they, you know, they do this thing where they curl their lip up.Yeah.And it's like a sexual thing.And that, for some reason, I don't know why, but I do that when I'm about to get into some love making.You do a little bit of that?And do you embody the lion?I don't know, I just have the thing.It's like, and they never stick around.Yeah.Flemish response takes place when one lion of either sex sniffs or smells the urine of another.Chemicals and hormones contain the urine elicit the Flemish response.Usually after smelling the urine patch on the ground [12:02] or vegetation, the cat is doing the smelling, will lift his or her head and hold her lips back in a strong grimace.Let me see it.Yeah, and I got it.It's just like, yeah, look.I got to start dating girls that wipe, I guess.Look at that face.That urine.Yeah.Look at it that right before it fucking closes down on your neck.gonna go, oh yeah, I'm not getting out of this.Here's fucking no escape, there's no hip escape, there's no jiu-jitsu move.There's no poking in the eye.That's a wrap, it's a wrap.Look at that mouth.That is a wrap, a wrap of the wrap.I had a moment when I was on Safari in Africa, where it's the only time in my life I started shaking.We were on a private land rover.We came up on two male lions that had just made a kill.We're literally probably, I'd say, 25 feet from them.And one of them got up and we're in the open land rover, right?[13:01] With no protection, no windows.So we got the guy driving from our camp, and this thing, one of them got up walked or a halfway to us and just did that burning stare with its golden eyes.Oh my God.And I was holding my hand, because it was one of the few times in my life, I felt like I was in death's door.Like that line could have been on me in two seconds and it was terrifying but exhilarating at the same time.How do they know that the lions won't jump into the cab and pull people out?They get acclimated to these kind of clunky things and look, I believe me, I know nature's unpredictable.Crossed, do you have to have?Well, I said to our driver, he was parked in front of a stump.I said to him, I said, dude, I know you do this every day.Get away from the stump.We need to have an exit strategy.Yeah.And so we'll be fine.I said, no, move from the stump.Cause nature, you don't know when nature's gonna do that.[14:05] Did you know it was gonna be an open air thing?Yeah, yeah.And you were cool with that?Yeah, it's beautiful.But I didn't know we were gonna come up on two male lions that were in the middle of eating a wildebeest and be the only ones there and like 25 feet away.And one of them was gonna shorten the distance by half.Oh God.Was this before or after the lady from Game of Thrones, who was the video editor?She's one of the video editors of Game of Thrones.She got pulled out of a car by all means.Oh, she did?Well, there you go.There's your answer, yeah.It can happen.I think it was a different situation, though.I don't think they were acclimated to the open air ones because in this one it was cars and she rolled her window down to reach out to take a picture and the catch is snatched her.It's like a toy.I mean you're basically rolling a piece of yarn.If you see, if a cat sees the thing that he couldn't get, but now he can get it, their [15:02] instinct is just to get it.Like even if they never would do that, if the windows are rolled down from the beginning.Yeah.The moment they see you peeking out.Yeah.Like you're basically like dangling.Yeah.Oh, yeah.Yeah.It's just a video of it.I know.So I just a picture.This is how it happened.Yeah.Oh God.That's so horrible, man.Oh my God.Look how big that thing is imagine that pulling you out of the fucking car.Oh my god So I was in Florida on whoo and I was doing a gig like on one side of Florida and had to cross over to the other side And in between we walking no no Daddy out of here's where it got clunky right I?I rented a convertible, right?Cause it's Florida.So I had time to kill, so I looked on the thing, halfway across, there's a lion safari where you can drive through, right?And you drove through in a convertible?No, so I pulled up and they said, sir, you can't go through the convertible, but for 10 extra dollars, [16:02] we'll rent you one of our little junkers and the junkers were painted like a zebra because it was a lion park.So they painted them with stripe.It was like a piece of crap that was just meant to go through the two mile park and out.So it's like a million degrees.It's Florida.It's Tuesday on one in the afternoon.No one's there because I'm cutting across the country.This is like a weekend place.They put me in this zebra mobile.I'm all alone in this park.I get right in the middle of the lion thing.There's like 60 lions.The carcans out.300 degrees.No AC because it's an old junker.And I just got 60 lion just going Zebra and I'm just sitting there no one's coming Daddy sitting there in the in the prize to sit there for I sat there for about 15 20 minutes till they came and I got to crack the window cuz it's like a it's like a dog in a Walmart parking lot [17:01] And it was and I'm sitting there going I'm a zebra I'm sitting there I'm a zebra you could die of heat exposure in there or by getting mulled by a pride alliance I mean they're gay if it's a pride alliance by the way no pride isn't always gay okay they look gay to me I didn't used to be gay used to be like you're proud of something one of them had their hair fluffed out he looks pretty gay it's actually in the Bible.Lions?Okay.Pride.Pride.It's not good.Wait.What do we talk about?Is it the same thing?I don't know.It's in the Bible.It's one of the sins.What?Pride?Yeah.Oh, yeah.It's one of the, yeah, there's six like.So why would you make a thing that is like I have American pride.I love America.I do have American pride.I'm a patriot.I think this is an amazing place.Yeah.So I have pride.So does that mean I'm gay or does it mean I'm sinning?Well, if it's just the verb, you're just you know what I'm saying?It's like what a flexible word.If you're trying to learn American English, [18:08] like how we use things, like just English, and you spoke another language that was more logical, you'd be like, what the fuck?Why don't you have different words?Yeah.Why do you have the same word?It means such different things.Like the word rose.Isn't there like seven different meanings for the word rose rose the flower rose up yeah right yeah yeah yeah it's just like right they just think I don't think of rose of corn yeah yeah rose the boat yeah oh my god there's so many yeah that's so stupid well there's two there there's ROSC and ROWF same sound did you want a sound yeah you obviously didn't they're making new pronouns sounds every day yeah you could have called.You could have called.You could have made a new pronoun sounds every day.Yeah.You could have called rows of corn, like clonk of corn.Yeah.Something that doesn't make me fucking confused.Wow.Especially if I'm learning the language, like I speak Portuguese or something, like, hold on my friend, this is the same word.Like, what What are you saying?What a goofy, it's you need so much context to be able to figure out, [19:06] I think English is supposed to be one of the most difficult languages to learn.I think Russian's very hard, Chinese is very hard, Mandarin's very hard.Manatee, is that what you said?Mandarin, like Chinese.Oh God.Imagine like you can speak it, but you can't read it or write it, Because that happens with a lot of Asian languages, like to learn Japanese.It's like speaking Japanese is hard, but now you have to learn how to read it and write it.Like that's extra hard.I got a story for you about that a little later.Do you learn Japanese?I saw it, well, Vietnamese.I saw it, I saw it, I saw it, I saw it, I saw it, I saw it.Well, you and NOM?Yeah.Possibly.I did two tours in NOM.And I gotta say, SunQuest Bus Lines.The best tours.Oh God.Air Condition Buses.It's got two tours.Right?Tourists.Very different meaning.[20:00] If you're talking about going to Vietnam in 1967.Huge difference.Big difference.And I found out.Do you mind if I just dip into, I brought a little something I have to do in about every 20 minutes I do apologize?What is it?I have to have an eating thing I have to do.Really?Well, if you don't mind.No, no, not at all.No.Oh, God.What is your eating thing?I have a tapeworm for real.Yeah Like I that's about almost four feet have you ever had one You really do?Yeah.I never know with you, you know.I don't know if I should feel bad or start mocking you.Well, you can do whatever.I don't know.I don't know if I like to feel bad if it's true.You have a real tapeworm?I do.How'd you get it, do you think?I was in the Galapagos Islands recently.And we, they have a rodent over there called the Bermuda eel rat.[21:07] And it's not a documented species.It's the local jargon.Everything evolves in, as you know, through Darwin, everything evolved over in the Galapagos, the tortoises, everything.It's a unique place where evolution took place.And I guess this wrap became a bit elongated, it's spined, and so they call it the, came off originally off of a Bermuda, like transport ship or something.Right.And so they eat it over there.And I ate the damn thing and I got a parasite that led to a tapeworm, and she's about a four footer.What do they do to get out?Get it out.Well they have pills but this is I don't even know if I should talk about this but I there's a little odd I sort of got attached to the little fella.Oh you like [22:04] having it now?Well you know we hear all this talk about, you know, women and men and men can have babies.They're telling men they can have children.Don't go to a little baby tapeworm.Well, let's just say I have something living inside me and I sort of like it.I sort of like sometimes I can feel it moving around.Sometimes I'll put a piece of cheese in the bed at night and it'll come out and I feel like I have a tail.And so what I have to do is I have to eat celery.Well what it does it reacts to the vibration of sound and celery's kind of got the best kind of crunch and It kind of settles the guy down Okay, just I just need to take a couple of bites.Are you good?[23:03] Well, you're gonna laugh.You have to do this about every 20 minutes for the tapeworm.Yeah, settles them down.I think you go into a bad doctor.I think you're getting bad advice.No, I just mean for me.For you.This is like a self-medicating.Yeah, I think they can get rid of those things, man.No, but what I'm saying, I've grown attached to demeatry.I like going with demeatry.It's probably like, you know, I have a forced labor.But I like demeatry.Yeah, but you can't keep a baby inside you forever.The whole idea is the baby gets born and then it goes out.Hold on, Dr.Spock.These suckers can grow up to 30 feet long.Mine's a four footer.Can they really get that big?How do they know how big is this?Would they do an MRI or something?Well, we did an ultrasound.And they could see the tape inside of it.[24:01] Do you got a picture of that?I don't have a picture handy.How do you not have a picture on your phone of that?Got my kid of little Dmitry?Yeah.It seems like he'd be really sad if you didn't have a picture of him.I got to bring one in.When I come back next week, I'll bring one in.Tapeworms are sesto, stesto, it's could range and length one meter up to 50 feet.50 feet dude 15 meters the length and width of the tapeworms can vary depending upon the species.Wow.Um, pork beef, fish tapeworms can grow to be 15 to 30 feet.Oh yeah.Permute a eel rat.Yeah.Do they have that there?How'd that rat taste?You know, it's kind of good.Yeah.They season it up with the Galapagos seasoning and it's kind of like blackened catfish, but it's like Galapagos seasoning.See, you think all those people that live there probably have tapeworms?I don't know if they have it, but I sure got it.They have to have it.If you got it, that must mean everybody has it.Unbelievable.There's places in the world that, especially like tropical places where most people have some kind of parasite.[25:07] It just becomes a part of your body.You now exist with that thing in you forever.You know?Have you ever had a tapeworm?No, I have not.Do you want one?No, thanks.What's the worst thing you've ever had?Like the worst weird ailment?Staff infection.No way how many people on your staff?It was a small business.Wow.Yeah.Yeah, just one employee.What's a staff infection?It's an infection that you get on your skin and it's like a bacterial infection.Exactly.And it's really common in Jiu Jitsu.And a lot of people get it and they don't recognize it.Ari actually had it and Ari didn't know he had it until I pointed it out.And we got him to the hospital right away.Ari and I were playing pool and he was limping.I'm like, why are you limping?And he goes, I got a spider bite and I go, let me see it.And he pulls his pants up and his knee, he has this swollen like pimple on his knee [26:08] and the pus at the end of it.I go, dude, you have a staff infection.I go, we gotta get you to the hospital right now.He goes, are you serious?Is it lethal?Yeah.It's lethal.Yeah, people die.If they get have died from staff.It happens all the time.Yeah, people get in and hospitals a lot, don't they?Yes, and unfortunately in hospitals, they get something called MRSA.And MRSA is medication-resistant staff infection.Wow.A lot of black gospel singers get that out of here.MRSA?Oh, that's MRSA, I'm sorry.What were you saying, Jamie?Didn't you say, didn't you say something?Oh, I thought I heard you.I thought I'd talk about numbers of people dying of staff infection.Yeah, I heard that too.How many people a year die from staff infections?I think it's a big number.Wow.I know quite a few people have been, [27:00] have been deathly ill from staff infections.So I had to go to the hospital and get their legs cut open and get their legs drained.Yeah.Yeah, it's a horrible, horrible thing to watch.Like it eats holes in people.You've watched staff infection surgeries?No, no, no.I mean, I've seen them online.2017, the Center of Disease Control Prevention reported that almost 20,000 people in the United States died from bloodstream infections caused by staff.That's 2017, he killed 20,000 people.Yeah, so that's the worst thing I've had, for sure.How long did it last?Didn't last very long because I caught it.I got real lucky, I caught it quick.I was at an airport with my friend Tate and I had this little pimples on my calf and he goes, uh, he goes, hey, uh, what is out of your calf?I go, I don't know, something.And he goes, did I think that staff?I go, really?He goes, yeah, he should get it looked at.So immediately I went to dermatologist and he's like, yeah, it looks like staff.And he put me in antibiotics before they even got the results of the test back.He put you on it, not your cow.My cow.I thought you said your calf.[28:06] Calf like leg.Part of your leg.That one, that one you really went out there with that one.That's the worst thing.Do you really have a tapeworm?I do.For real.Yes.Please.And what do they, they have you on Ivermectin?What do they have you on?They don't have, they just, you can't get it, all they do is kill it.It can live in your system.They told me for your whole life.Right.Yeah, you ever seen bears?They have them like sticking out of their ass.Oh yeah.Like a fucking hose, like a garden hose, just hanging.You ever seen the worms that come out of praying mantises?Oh yes, this is it.They're like, huge, huge.They put a praying mantis in water, and that bastard must not have been praying enough because it's got a tapeworm longer than Dolly Parton's ass hair.Not only that, those worms, those aquatic worms, trick grasshoppers into drowning themselves.[29:00] They could be, what are you doing, man?Don't do that.'t know the pulp I know but don't just grab it and put it I know but it was I felt like I was chewing cod well I put it on the other celery Okay, I would never put cod on your table the celery please well I don't want the meat tree to get upset You need to reach into your asshole and pull the meat tree out Wow, you need to like you, like with your shoulders down the ground, ask up here, just get it.Get it in there.Joseph and give birth.Joseph, dial it down.I'm not gonna, is he ever turtle on you?Yes, does he?That's why column to meet you.One night I put out a piece of fetiches, the Greek stuff, and he went nuts, came out.Came out.If you ever seen a Burmese python, yes.I had a lady friend over, and I guess little Dimitri got jealous, and I woke up all I heard was, yeah, yeah, yeah.And I looked over.[30:02] He was, yeah, unbelievable.How are you laying?Spooning?Like where's her face?Is it like right where your ass is?Well, we spoon upside down.It's over.It makes sense.She uses her, my nose like a bicycle rack.He have to come.He's not pretty, but he's my boy.Yeah, it's not pretty, but he's my boy.How long is it going to take to kill him?I don't want to kill him.This is why I'm...Not but for real, for real.How long is it going to take to kill it?Well, once you take those pills, you can kill it within about three days.And you're not taking the pills?No.I'm telling you a guy, you know, I feel like I have a boy inside me.Wow, wait a minute.Like a child.Okay.Well, good luck with that.Thank you.If you see, I want to see a photo of those bears.Hmm.The bears that have it, it's so disgusting.It looks like like enormous spaghetti.[31:02] Oh, it's a ten-year ass.Have you ever been attacked by a bear?No.Oh, it was a 10-year-old.Have you ever been attacked by a bear?No.I'm here, right?Well, look at that.There are survivors and I couldn't.Look at that tapeworm coming out of his asshole.How crazy is that?Whoa, looks like he just got married.You should put 10 cans on the end of those.Look at me that's looking.He just hoping someone steps on it so he could pull it out of his ass.Yeah.Looks like he was parachuting and he landed and he's dragging the parachute.I mean, how insane is that?Wow.I mean, their whole body is just a disgusting mess.Yeah.Like when you eat bears.You eat bear?You have eaten bear.Gris, black bear, polar.Black bear.Black bear.Black bear, not gris.No, I've eaten bear grizz black bear polar black bear black bear not grizz No, I've never had one else.What's what's the white?Why do you black bear?Well, I did them.Yeah, yeah They have to but I heard it's kind of a musky kind of weird taste No, it really depends on what they've been eating but most unfortunately most of those bears are probably eating calves [32:03] moose calves and Fonds deer fawns they tasted good black bears are kind of like goats though.They'll eat just about anything They'd a lot do you know then the early days the pioneers used to eat bear and they would use deer for skin Say again, you just use deer skins.They just use the the hide from deer.They were eating bear Oh, I see bear more than they ate anything else.Is that right?Yeah, am that crazy?Well, maybe there was a reason for that because the bear was a threat to them.So maybe it's like, let's kill the thing that could kill our cattle or kill our children and let's eat that versus the docile.This is just a theory.I just cannot put just a theory.I just cannot put it.Not a good theory.That makes sense.You know, we definitely want to kill the thing that's killing your food.And if you could eat it too, all the better.And apparently they thought it tasted the most like beef.Whereas like venison is different.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.So they ate a lot of bear.[33:02] Black bears are dangerous, but grises are the one you gotta be careful about.They're all dangerous, man.They're all bears.I don't know if it can I share something with you?Please do.I'm a blueberry nut.Like I might like blueberries.When blueberry season hits in early spring, I'm nuts about it.How's the meat you feel about that?Well, she like salary.I'll give them berries.There you make fun of my boy.So anyway, blueberries.So this was about seven years ago.I'm up on a hill in Bamp, out in Canada, in the Rocky Mountains.Gris, you know, Gris, and I'll use a line from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.Remember our Caracodus Pots?He was the father to Dick Van Dyke.And he used this line where he's singing.He goes, he's doing a song in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and he doesn't [34:00] line where he goes.And the bear came a lullip in over the mountain.And I'm sitting there pickin' blueberries.And this behemoth comes flying over the hill.So that was a grizzly bear.It was a grizz.And when they attack, they roll you.They roll and claw.And I've never done this, but...and I've never done this but you're such a dork hey fuck it what can't.Dude, this is not easy for me to talk about.I'm sick that I can't.The bear came a lola pin over the mountain.And uh...That tattoo belongs to a mechanic in Idaho and you need to give it back to him.[35:01] So...Let me see it again.What the...Let me see it again what the I'm you see it again the back of my lullipin over the mountain what there you said that the longest anyone's ever gone for a gag that's that is yeah it's the furthest anyone's ever gone you actually got a tattooed on your chest.Well, hang on, guy.I'm trying to tell you, I got attacked by a gris.No.No.You know what?No.No.No.No.No.No.No.Oh my god.No.No.No.No.No.No.No Oh my God.It probably barely should sell.And you know what I did?I did a thing I've meant to call the jelly roll.Because I'm in the blueberries, the only way to evade the gris, I rolled down the hill.He's ripping my chest, straight down the hill into a river.[36:01] Boom.Bouncing around like Moses.Blueberry jelly.Blueberry jelly.Blueberry jelly.Blueberry Moses, Blueberry Jellic.Blueberry Jellic.Burculosis teeth.You making jelly as you roll through the hookers.I'm crushing the, yeah.And this bear was just buffuddled, just stood there, looked like forest gump with a Chinese dildo up his ass.Now a mountain lion on the other hand.Can I share something with you?This is involved in other chat, too.Well, no, the mountain lion.What the fuck is that?He...Did you glue those on?What the fuck is wrong with the mountain lion?Scrapes.He digs in with his claws.What is wrong with you?Can a guy have adventure stories in nature?Yeah, that those that make up artists whoever did that, but they're like from the Twilight Zone, same person.[37:02] St.Persons.That alien's head.same person.Same person.That alien's head.It fell off.Hey, you're healing by the power of Jesus.Oh God.You're healing.Yeah.But here's where I talked to you earlier about learning Mandarin.Here's the difference between the evolution of nature, mammals, critters, and human beings.Cut to about eight years ago, the McKenzie River, and there's white water like you wouldn't believe.Little Vietnamese boy, his name Kimmy Long Wow.Freckles on his face, unbelievable.Tips, okay.Bears, wild cats, they just scratch.The ingenuity, the intelligence of a human.I jump in, grab little Kimmy Long Wow.[38:03] He starts scratching me me can I show you something look at this this kid scratched the shit out of me and even in a panic state I had to learn mandarin This is towards the night before Christmas.Well...She's a big man.Unbelievable.What was his name again?Little Kimmy Long Wow.He had freckles on his face.It looked like Dolly Parton serving Apple Cobbler if you join them.He is Vietnamese.Vietnamese boy.Well, why would a Vietnamese kid have freckles?That seems uncommon.That's what was so weird.That's how he stood out amongst all the other boys.A child of an American GI.I don't know, but just unbelievable kid.To see a little Vietnamese boy with freckles, [39:03] you don't get that.How many American, like that was always a thing, like those Chuck Norris action movies, remember?Like missing an action.There was always about guys that were still stuck over there and we had to go get them.Nobody kind of forgot about that.Are those the guys that inspired you, like Norris?Oh yeah, that's right.Yeah, Bruce Lee.Like when you were a kid, did you sneak into the movies?I went to the movies and then there was on television too when I was a kid.The first Bruce Lee movie I ever saw was on television.Yeah.You couldn't believe it.I was like, look at that.That's insane.How's he doing that?But like those missing in action movies was all about missing POWs.And then we always use a talk, that was always a thing that like the POWs from Vietnam got left behind.Yeah.And like, you know, Chuck and Ars can go back and get them and set them free.And yeah.How many POWs got left behind in Vietnam?Because that's a, that's a fucking real thing man.Now it was a bullshit war, [40:00] but people went over there and they left them there.John McCain, remember him?The Paul He was a prisoner for years.His shoulders were all fucked up.Yeah, he couldn't put his arms down.Like he was, I remember I went on a roller coaster with him once and at the end of it, I was like, Guy, it's done and he was still.That's how crazy Trump is.Trump made a fun of him getting caught.Yeah.No, he, That's how crazy Trump is.Trump made a fun of him getting caught.Yeah.No, he, Trump said, well, I like guys that didn't get caught.Yeah, whatever.Yeah.Are you saying it?Yeah.Like you were gonna run away.You would run away.Would you be?Yeah.If you're his enemy, he doesn't give a fuck.He'll say anything.You're skewered.You're skewered.Even if it doesn't make any sense, they'll say like, what?Guys, you don't get caught.What?Yeah.How can you fucking say that about a war hero?It's like Jesus Christ.That's true.It's wild.Crazy, but he's my enemy.Fuck him.No, no holes barbed battle mode.[41:00] How many American soldiers got left behind?Get down.I was trying to find out.And this is by the way, they're not gonna tell you the real number, right?They're not?No, they didn't tell you why we're going into the war in the first place.I'm sure that even the death count was probably disputed.Who knows?Have you ever romanticized being in combat like that?Even though it's the death zone.Have you ever like, because you're a hunter, you're skilled with the rifle.Have you ever sort of imaginary, like immersed yourself into a Vietnamese battle scene?No, nor could I imagine those guys who got conscripted.They got drafted.So you didn't even want to do it.Maybe you just wanted to build cars.Maybe you wanted to be a painter.Now I'll say, and you're over there with a rifle and you're in the dark, in the jungle.But does the hunter side of you go in there and imagine like you could excel in that environment?No, the hunter is a totally different experience.[42:01] The hunting side of me is like dipping my toe into the natural world, like getting my food the hard way.That's the hunter in me is going out and finding food and interacting with nature.But the, the Elk are not my enemy.I love them.Right, but is there a thrill to the kill though?There has to be a moment of sort of adrenaline and jubilation when you man conquer's beast.Does that exist?The thrill is that you pulled off a difficult thing.It's very hard to do.And it's very hard to make a shot with a bow and arrow on an animal.It's far in a lethal shot.And to be able to do it consistently.To do it every time you hunt, to be able to make a lethal shot and I'm talking about it like 50 yards 60 yards.Oh wow.Do you strictly use bone arrow?Yes.Oh, I didn't know that I thought you Shoot with rifles.I killed a pig last year with a rifle.Wow with the farmer sausage.It was a wild one.Oh Big pretty big 200 pounds Texas.No, this was in California.And so I ate him just the other day.What she said?[43:07] That was a boy.It's a boy pig.No, I said what she's sag.I know what you're saying California is that a joke an actor joke?Yeah, I got you I got you.What was I saying though?What was I on about?Well, you were talking about the hunting versus the.War to me is insane.I don't know what I mean.I don't want to have nothing to do with that.I wouldn't really know.There's no little piece of you that you're in the dark jungle.I'm someone's boy, that's someone's baby boy.I don't think of it even as a man.That's someone's baby boy that I don't know.That guy has parents and they really love him and he probably has a wife and she loves him and he probably has friends and they love him.And they just said that.And then some fucking politician is telling me that that guy's my enemy.I bet that guy and I, if we could speak the language we'd have a beer together and have a good time.What a great answer.He probably doesn't want to have anything to do with killing me and I don't want to have anything both being suckered into this thing by a bunch of assholes who are just making money.I love that answer, Joe.[44:05] If I could fly over this table and hug you, I would.We hug a lot.But it reminds me of a movie.Did you ever see this old movie with Lee Marvin?And I can't remember the other actor.He was a Japanese actor.But this was a movie I think in the 60s, where they're both in the war the Japanese pilot and Lee Marvin they both crashed on a remote island Supreme enemies and they only had each other and a box of socky somehow got stranded on the island and they became the best friends In the world and I think if everyone looked through that prism in life They would forget about all the war and the violence.When you realize someone else is exactly like you.Exactly.And that you need someone else.And they have the same fears, desires, passions, and wants as you.It's such a beautiful movie, you know.It's where all the freaking same, [45:00] whenever you get into an altercation with someone, you feel disliked towards someone, you should always just pitch yourself, trapped on an island with that person and go, you know what, if I were alone with them, I would love them, they'd be my best friend.You'd figure it out.It's a mental thing.If everyone kind of adopted that mentality, I think we'd, things would be nice.Things could be a lot better.We're just, we're divided by so many things in this world.We're divided by politics.We're doing, you hear like Robert De Niro screaming in front of people about Trump like, horrible.What are you doing?Like what is this?Like this is like silly behavior.All this is so silly.Not only that, labeling them, calling them clowns and denigrating them, saying, you're less than me because I like this and you like that.It's all insane Do you remember that there was a beautiful experiment done by Jane Elliott in the 1960s Where she took a classroom of children and she said all the children with brown eyes raise your hands and all the children with blue eyes [46:01] Raise your hands and she separated them and She she you can find it on YouTube.She told all the blue eyed children that they were beautiful, they were smarter, they were more superior than the brown eyed children.And she conducted this experiment for a week and over the course of the days, the blue eyed children started denigrating and looking down on the brown-eyed children and acting superior.And then halfway through the experiment, Jane Elliott goes, oh, I made a mistake.It's the brown-eyed children that are more superior.And so the whole thing shifted.And all the children in that class got to feel what it was like to be put down to, you know, have racism towards them.It was a fascinating experiment.It's on YouTube if you ever want to watch it.It's mesmerizing.It's an interesting experience, but like what the fuck lady, you're playing tricks on kids?[47:03] Well, I think she was trying to dump she should get your Demonstration, but you're also tricking these kids in the Thinking that way.Well, I think she was setting the table for them in life saying, Hey, maybe don't think you're better than Anyone were all the same and don't let people tell you you're Better than everyone.And and it was also a social experiment That was documented too.So there was a, would you let your kid do that?Do that kind of experiment?Yeah, if they didn't know.Would you let him sign up for that?Yeah.And talk shit to the blue eyed kids.You know what, I'd let my kid do it.I hope I would've told my kid a long time ago that that would be nonsense and that they wouldn't believe that.Right, I would teach my kid that, but it's one thing to tell a kid something, and then to let something play out in the real world is it's a different thing.People, humans have a tendency to get caught up in the fever of things, you know?Like COVID.Like COVID, like politics.[48:00] Like politics.Like all of this stuff, yeah, people.Anytime there's any sort of international conflict Yeah, I'll sign in Israel got Ukraine and Russia you have a sect of people that sort of know what's what and then you have a Large sect of people that just get caught up in the furor of it and it's it's scary to see how quickly people are absorbed by it and and caught up in it.It's frightening.Well, you've never been to a protest?No.Protest feel like a mob.It feels dangerous.When there's a bunch of people walk around even if it's peaceful, and they're cheering, especially if they're cheering about something that happened that was violent, and they're angry, and they're demanding something, and they're all marching.It's like you, I think that ignites in human beings the same feelings of war.Yeah.This is my cough button, still busted, Jamie, do you swap that out?You okay?It's gonna be a pain to ask the swap that.We had a cough button.[49:02] I don't think that's working there yet.Should I try?No, no, it's just a flam.Well, I'm good to go.I don't need celery.Please, for no thank you.Why?I don't have any tapeworms and I don't enjoy celery.We're kidding, you're excited with peanut butter.Do you have any peanut butter?I don't know.Hahaha.This motherfucker might have peanut butter.How about a cauliflower?That's not the same thing.Well, it's got the same letters in it.No, no, no.It doesn't have all of them.It's missing the bee.I thought you like cauliflower.No.Well, now what am I gonna do?Just put it down.Well, what were we just talking about before that?You okay guy.Yeah, I just got this lemon thing.Oh, maybe you've got a lemon Maybe Oh, I like that Imagine what they can smell you ever do that noise when you're making love no [50:01] Why not what the fuck are you doing dude?It his primal women love it should get up and leave no I'm here as an experiment from me to you I want you to try that normal noises next time you're making love not to get into your purse I respect yours personal space but doggy style right by her ear Carl just started barking.Listen to Carl.Listen to Carl.Wow.Have you ever seen Carl do that?It's Carl I've done that before.So a few noises in here.I've been walking up by his.Wow.He's fired up.That is crazy.Look, he really believes.I have a calling dogs, is that thing?Yeah.I'd have a really good career in called dogs.What's your your growl?What's your growl?What's your growl?What's your growl?What's your growl?What's your growl?What's your growl?[51:01] What's your growl?Oh Dude you gotta call believes it you gotta try that with your wife Sorry Carl oh god, he thinks he's walked into a wolf pack Yeah, he's like someone's gonna eat me.This is bullshit.These guys have been pretending to be my friends I've been let me bite their fingers the whole time they're setting me up dude.I'm telling you try caro try that with the wife Okay, we got it Poor Carl Poor doodle Carl poor Carl.He's like what the fuck that's a good good noise Thank you Where'd you where'd you acquire that skill because I learned it when we had I went out of puppy I would I would try to I like to communicate to animals in their own language if you can right do you have dogs?Yeah, do you just talk to him you don't do that hardly ever barks He very very very rarely barks hill bark if he has to go outside like if he has diarrhea [52:01] He'll bark like right you're by the door and go, oh fuck, Chad help me out.Whoa.Or he'll bark if he sees something.He used to, what he used to bark.Carl's done, huh?Wow, he's terrifying.He's time.No, he wants to bite us, man.Ooh, blue gangster.He'll, you remember those inflatable snowmen that people would have on their front lawn yeah around Christmas time.Yeah, yeah, yeah, he barks at those What your dog why?He thinks it's a thing he like like what's it tell me there's a big animal there.He's like letting me know Yeah, he's like dad What the fuck is that dad?It's a Yeti like one of those a vulnerable snowman.I bet he thinks it's a bear I bet it's just like I bet in a dog's mind There's a shape that is two arms that stands up big and you go bark Yeah, yeah, and I got to go do that.It's just that's a snowman.Don't worry about it I love it that your dog has a diarrhea bark.He has a I got to go out now bark, but you said diarrhea Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, same thing [53:01] It's basically hey I got it Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.It's basically, hey!I got the ride!Hey!Let's go to Taco Bell.I got a funny video that I'll send to Jamie and then we'll watch it because it was him last night.Because last night he hadn't gone out in like four hours and there was thunderstorms outside.And when there's thunderstorms outside, he fucking freaks out.He freaks out like I can't watch TV with him when when there's Thunderstorms he just like yeah when we watch TV together.Yeah, we we sit on the couch and we cuddle So I sit like this and he like puts his head like on my lap.What kind of dog is a golden retriever?Oh yeah Sweetest dog of all time.Yeah, perfect.Sometimes I don't even hear it, you know, because I'm watching the movie, but all of a sudden, who just runs, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, Last night, he had a pee.I'm like, I know you have to pee.[54:06] It's like midnight.Come on, bro.Look at this.He kept jumping at me.He kept jumping at me.Look at him.He's so potted.This is all just because of the lightning.Oh, wow.Oh, wow.Oh, I should have passed the bus.He's shining I He's jumping happy He's just all he does is just jump at me But normally he'd just go out and pee 100% The lighting was literally never does this wow, but he's wagon his tail He loves it.I mean he's excited right?He's does tails not between his legs But he's just freaked out.Maybe he's got the diarrhea, but he's afraid to start so he doesn't get electrocuted Yeah, wow [55:02] Come on go potty Marshall please go potty He wouldn't pee I had to bring him back in the house.He just wouldn't not pee He just was just wanted to jump up and just freaked out He wanted to make sure that I was okay Like I'm with him you're okay like he wants to be on top of you when the lightning's happening weird Yeah, he's just like who are we okay?I'm like, we're okay.Like, as long as I'm okay, he thinks it's okay.He's like, we gotta get the fuck outta here.Like, his instincts are like, we're not supposed to be out in the open.This is dangerous.Wait, how old is he?Seven.Oh, so you'd years ago and he'd never really saw lightning.Like very rarely do you see lightning in California.Yeah, you're right.And we're here thunder.Yeah, you're very very very rarely do you have those kind of crazy storms that you're out here.The storms they have out here are fucking wild.Yeah.[56:04] Some guy posted a video yesterday, Jimmy, on Instagram of his car getting destroyed by Hale in Texas.Like some insane, like four inch Hale chunks.You see his windshield shattering, his back windshield, windshield got blown out while he's driving.He's like, this is insane.He's watching his car just get destroyed.It's rocks, just rocks dropping out of the sky.Yeah, sometimes I think they actually puncture right through the roof, like through the metal.Oh yeah, you gotta think of how far, if you've got a four inch chunk of ice that's hurling from space, like it's basically in the clouds.Look at that.Oh wow.What the fuck dude?That looks like Jeff Kennedy's car.He had a convertible.Oh yeah.He broke windows.Wow.Yeah.Fucks these cars up.Whoa he's fingering it.I got it's, I wonder how many people get killed by Hale every year.There's a good question.Looks like they got a kill.What What kills more staff or hail?I don't know, but I know they say about, uh, I [57:07] Think they say 12 to 30 people a year.This is for real yet killed by a falling coconut 150 Well, or 150 people a year 150.Yeah.Yeah, I've gone up We were talking about like things that kill people, but they like inflate numbers.Like marijuana kills zero.Coconut's falling on people's health.That's kill 150 people.We're not outlawing coconuts.Yeah.You know what I'm saying?Can you imagine getting killed by a coconut?It was suck.What a way to go.It's not good.It's not a good way to go.Especially if you're like person yeah everything's going great like if Steve Jobs had gotten killed by a coconut or is a little I'm not asking you know I must have killed by a coconut yeah you would know what believe it like yeah I made that coconut yeah yeah yeah while dangerous according to the N O A A oh since 2000 only four people have been killed by hail wow oh.Oh, wow.How many people could you kill every year by lightning?[58:06] Let's guess.Okay.60.I'll say.I don't know why I said 60.200.200.Worldwide?Globally.Globally.Yeah, you're probably right.20 in the US.20 in the US.Wow.Every year.So what does a globally?Got a figure that Chinese are getting picked off by because they got billion, right?You got the odds are and they have skyscrapers the living skyscrapers.I'm just kidding long.Why was gonna get it?24,000 wow 24,000 a year.Yeah killed by lightning.Well, we were both way off.Wow Whoa, it was a lot less than I thought would be in America.Yeah.60 is what I thought in America.Wow.Have you ever been hit by lightning?No, but my friend Remi has.Remi, did he live?Yeah, he lived.He was here on the podcast a couple days ago.Oh, [59:00] shit.He got hit by lightning.I think when he was in high school I think it made him deaf for a little bit.I really fucked him up.Wow Yeah, he didn't realize what happened.He just woke up on the ground and That a piece of together that he got hit by lightning Yeah, electronic charge going through the air Unbelievable.Have you seen what's going on right now in?Where is it where there's these, is it Uruguay?Where is it where there's insane lightning storms that are coming out of that volcano?Oh yeah, I saw that.It's a different kind of lightning.So it's the particles, the charged particles that are being released by the lava ignites with the air somehow, we'll get to that.Yeah released by the lava ignites with the air somehow will get the smoke.It's a different kind of light.The steam that the particles get caught in the steam, the translucent.And it makes these insane lightening shows.Like look at this.Yeah.Indonesia.Yeah.But it's been going on like a lot lately.[1:00:03] Like even during the day, there's a lot of films on TikTok and Instagram and stuff about it.Bro, that is so bonkers.That mean if you were alive 5,000 years ago and you saw that, you're like, oh, Satan, that's where Satan lives.Satan's back.Fuck, he's back.Dude, I got news everybody.We're fucked man.Satan's back.Look, look at the mountain Satan landed on the top of the mountain.He's there with lightning and shit like you You saw this You'd be like okay, that's where Satan is Well 100% you would think yeah, that's where Thor is.Yeah, that's where the God of thunder is That's where the bells above live.Yeah, look at that what you would 100% Sauron lives up there Well, you know I have sauron people don't know that lightning comes up out of the ground, too Did you know that Joe doesn't really yeah lightning comes people just think all lightning comes from and I'm not talking of Alcano I'm talking regular time so you could get it right up there If you're in the wrong spot you could get a bolt up your arse [1:01:01] But for real he imagined you could just your nuts blasted by lightning.Ford to me, tree.How bad would that suck?Just be walking along in the field, going, wow, what a beautiful night.Bang.From the ground.Yeah, that's true.Right to your sack.Yeah, do you have any pitches of that?Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-j.Out to your head.J-j-j.Three your balls out to your head.Yeah.J-j-j-j.Just cooked.Cooked.Cooked.Never be the same again.Cooked.What was that noise you did at the end now?That's the nuts.Like, you've got to think the electricity's going through the ground in your nuts and like out the top of your head Just imagine your whole body like captured by this lightning It would be like stepping on a land mine, but you didn't blow up you just it just can look at that Oh, you're not out of the ground lightning trailing from ground to clouds in slow motion.Now while [1:02:05] That's insane.It's like an etchous sketch People don't really know these things and that's why it's important you have me on the show I'm really glad twice a month type of deal.I'm really glad you're here for this Yeah, how cool that looks in slow motion.That's what's really happening.Fuck it.Look at that right out of the ground That's as big as any lightning strike you'll see coming out of the sky.God damn, that's amazing.Yeah, that looks a lot like the metri I gotta say.Oh, little branches.And this is all in slow motion.Look how quick those little branches flicker off in the corners in the size.That looks a lot like the metri's ultrasound by the way.I bet.Yeah.Just so we're clear.Lightning is fucking cool.That's one of the interesting things about living years.We have these lightning storms.You get to watch lightning.Yeah.Florida.I think it's one of the most lightning, lightning active places on the planet.Oh yeah.Yeah.Florida.Florida's like, this is light curve.[1:03:01] Hurricane season there.Yeah.Like if you're planning to trip to Florida now, like, hey, you know, check that weather.Yeah, but it can be stunningly beautiful though.I've been in scenarios where I've been in Florida at night and you got celery juice on me.And you look out like two, three miles out and there will be active storms going on in the cumulus, right?The degenerative molecular charged transphyxiation particles are lighting up the clouds, and it's like you're at a Judas Priest concert covered in mayonnaise.You got another thing, guys.Yeah, just a ch...And it's like all over.Do you believe in the matrix?I don't disbelieve in it because if you ever want to have it, I've got this chemically reversed, inverse magnet, magnetron camera.And one of the things we associate with the matrix is what?[1:04:00] The numbers coming down in green.So if you can take a picture, think of it.Where does that exist in reality?But if you can go out on a stormy night like that, rain coming down with your magnetized nitronic reverse camera and take a picture while lightnings flashing, think of it.It's matrix.What are what are rain drops?Water.Right.But not when you take them with an infrared matronica camera.What are they then?You'll see numbers in the you can see it.Yeah.Interesting.If you believe in that stuff.Well, person got to believe in something.Do you believe in it?What?The matrix.I don't disbelieve in it.You know, I can tell you that you've experienced it in real time.How can you do that?A little term, Joe Rogan called deja vu.Mm.Have you ever experienced deja vu?Yes.So think of it.How can you be in a place that you've never been before?[1:05:03] You're standing somewhere foreign, somewhere new, and all of a sudden your brain computes that you've been in this exact moment and it's undeniable, right?How is that happening?What's not really undeniable?Well, it is undeniable because you're in it, right?It's probably a glitch in how you interface with reality.Therefore, glitch in the matrix.Well, it's probably how your brain's firing.Your brain has just like, brain is essentially just like a computer in a way.There's a lot of calculations that are going on.So I'm not telling you so you'll have sensors that are being considered different senses or affecting the way you view the world.And I think it's very possible They you get to have a situation where things just get a little wonky for a second and you think have I Done this before have I done it before but how are you or?You have done it before and [1:06:02] Every time you do this you try to do it better and You live the same life over and over and over again until you get it right.A lot of people believe that.That's a good theory.It plays into what I'm going for here.Yeah.I had a moment in time where I had deja vu.I'm not going to say where and when because I don't want anyone to interfere with it.But I've never told anyone this before.I had a place in time where I was walking, I was going under a bridge, a pigeon flew out, okay?A child was laughing in the background, like a child, like he, you know, like a giggle, a playground giggle, and a red car went by, you know, like a giggle, a playground giggle, and a red car went by and I was like, I've been here before, a place I'd never been.So I documented the experience, the time, the place, and I've gone back to that same place [1:07:08] for nine years to the exact same place at the same time.Check this out.Red car goes by, bird flies out, pigeon, kid laughing in the background.But this year something different happened that I'd never seen a feather fell off the bird when it flew out.So check flew out.So check this out.You see the feather?Don't get ahead of me.So the matrix must be real.Well hold on, I got this exam and I have a lot of friends in the science community.I know a bunch of Scientologists, and I had them analyze this.Pigeon flew out here.I'm good.This is a feather from a great ock.Do you know what that is?It's an extinct species of bird from South America.[1:08:03] Hmm, please.That's okay, just's put it down.Well, I think you'd like to touch it.Nope.I'm good.So how does an extinct species of bird drop a feather from a common pigeon?Who knows, man.That's it?That's the animal.Looks like that animal did really have feathers.It did, believe me, and I'm holding one right here.What extinct 350 years ago?Is that what it was?Matrix.Oh, when from healthy to extinct in 350 years, they probably taste delicious.They're probably stupid and they taste delicious.That's what happens.The great ock.Little cutie.Can that thing even fly?No, it sounds like a bullshit story if the How's that feather get there?Well, this is what I'm saying.This thing lives near the ocean the matrix You just found a feather that made someone drop it floated off of the pigeon that for nine years [1:09:00] Maybe not maybe it just was near where the pigeon was and it was flying through the air because someone had an Ock like taxidermy in the apartment building and that feather just kept drifting in the way and just Coincidentally as the pigeon was passing that feather was making its way I like my god look would fell off the pigeon an ancient extinct Ock feather but meanwhile was just someone was in an apartment building with taxidermy of the arc, and they had the window open, the fan on.Two Shay.You never know.Could be magic though.Could be.I like what I'm hearing.Did you think this is the matrix?Like if this is a simulation, what does it say about your choice?I'd like how you've chosen to exist in the simulation.I don't know that we have a choice.You don't think so?Well, the matrix is numbers, it's mathematical, so do we really have a choice?Did we have a choice that we were conceived?Did we have a choice that are?We don't think we did, right?Maybe we do.Or maybe it's inevitable.You know, maybe there's just this mathematical cycle [1:10:03] of atoms and protons and molecules interacting with each other.And just this is the way it's always going to go.It's going to go this way the same way over and over and over again.And the only thing different is that you get to learn from your past mistakes, at least some way in the essence of your being, and do a better job of existing this next go around.I don't know that we have and do a better job of existing this next go around.I don't know that we have to do a better job.I don't think we have a choice.I think evolution just takes us.We're just hanging on to bear's tapeworms at this point.You know?Yeah, but if you live the same life over and over and over again, you're gonna go through the same nature interaction over and over again.It's not gonna be like a differently evolved world.You're gonna live the same thing over and over again.I give you thought about it, like you and I.How old do you?Wow.I'm 56, how old are you?61.Are you really?Yeah, for real?Yeah.You look really good.[1:11:00] Thank you.You do, you look really good.Except the scars.You look really good.Except the scars.You're a little beat up.I've been rolled by a grouse.We have gone through one of the weirdest lives.You know, and if the simulation is real, and if you wanted, if the simulation wanted you to go through the most profound changes that human beings have ever experienced in the time of their life, just in how people interface with the world.You and I have done that.We exist.We were born in a time where there was no internet and you got your news from television and everybody had a sort of a limited understanding of the world.You could bullshit your way through most things because nobody could Google you.Nobody could get a book on you.You couldn't just run to the library and find out if Mike was telling the truth about his war stories.You had to just build up the people.Yeah, the microfiche things.Everything was possible.The world was a different place.You know, then there's answering machines and cell phones and then the internet comes along and now we're living in a fucking insane world [1:12:01] where AI's about to take over.Like if you were gonna pick a timeline to go through, if it wasn't real, and you wanted the most profound adventure, you've chosen that.Yeah.You've chosen the most profound changes that people will experience in a relatively safe timeline, relatively safe in comparison to like the Genghis Khan days or the days of the Roman Empire, like this relatively safe in comparison to like the Ginghis Khan days or the, you know, the days of the Roman Empire, like just relatively safe in comparison.But profound changes for this moment.Yeah.And we're accelerating so rapidly, Joe, that things are going to be at a whole nother level quickly where we're going to be looking in the rear view mirror and going, oh, yeah, AI.Remember that?Yeah.There's gonna be something that takes us to the next level.And then another level after that, we are gonna transcend so far that I don't even know what humans and humanity looks like in a thousand years, if not less.[1:13:01] Oh, not, I don't think it's even 50 years.Yeah.That's what's crazy.You and I are living through the weirdest time ever.Yeah, because it started like we kind of had in high school for us.It was the Texas Instrument calculator.Yep.Was the mind blower.Yep.Then we got a facts machine like 15 years later insane.And then we got the the laptop, the home computer and then the internet and that was again like a decade in between and cut to smartphones and it's been about what 15 years with them now.Yeah.Now AI and it's just like everything's happening exponentially quicker.I remember I was on news radio with Dave Foley in the 90s.Dave Foley's a big computer internet technology.He loves that stuff.Yeah.And at the time he was the first person I ever met who had a laptop.Okay.So he had a laptop back then was one of those Mac laptops, the black plastic ones back in the day.[1:14:02] And he had this app running in the background where it gave him constant news.He's like, look, if I keep it connected to the internet, it constantly gives me news.Yeah.And I was like, whoa, you get your news from the internet?This is crazy.So it's like all the news stories of world events.And so when I look back now and how we're just inundated, like constantly inundated with like world conflict stories, world events, world problems, world environmental crisis, world starvation, world floods, like world volcanoes with lightning, like oh, it's gonna never fucking, I remember that moment, that very moment when I was looking at Dave's laptop and I was like, wow.The internet just gonna feed you the news in real time.You don't have to tune into the news, you don't have to go buy a newspaper.This was like this profound moment for me where I still looked back at that day and I thought that was the first time I ever saw like a baby, a baby supercomputer.[1:15:02] Oh, look at the baby, the baby.The news.And ironically, you're on a show called news radio.Crazy.Very wrong.Very, very.Very, very.Yeah.Yeah, I'm excited to see where, where it goes.Cause I think the next, the next evolution of this could be tractor beams.It could be particle movers.It could be, you know, as ridiculous as it sounds, the transporter beam on Star Trek.I feel like, you know, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years, people are gonna look back and go, wait, you went to a place called an airport?You got on a tube and flew 18 hours to Australia.Like, I think we're gonna be at a place one day where maybe they can rearrange our molecules and particles and be must.I feel like if we can imagine it, it's gonna happen.Yeah, I bet it's gonna happen.I mean, cause think of it.It was funny that Star Trek figured that out, but they didn't figure out computers, [1:16:01] and they didn't figure out cell phones.They had walkie talkies, remember?Well, they had the communicators.Over.Yeah, but it was a walkie talkies.It wasn't.It wasn't.Got diarrhea, something, some pepto, bismolimadie play.But it wasn't, you couldn't both talk.Like if you and I were on a phone call, you would miss up Harlan, hey, what's up, Are you over yeah, and there was no video component yet those idiots in you now face down Don they got to get back to the future.They didn't have nothing dumb asses Yeah, remember that yeah, that's it twirly thing you look at that I should trip like kaleidoscope and who knows what those buttons we have yeah, it doesn't even label I actually think I think I'm the beach.I think it's an electric razor if you ask me I think it's straight bullshit.Yeah, I think it's a garage door opener I like how it had to flip close though.I just love that about old phones when you can hang up Oh, I love that Shut the fuck off you Yeah, like those razor phone Grudge door.I remember I had one of those razor phones.I thought I was James Bond [1:17:02] Yeah, you could express yourself with them but now the razor phone was the shit.Yeah, what did that one do?It was just this thin little beautiful piece of metal.And it didn't, it had a terrible battery life, unfortunately.Because most phones had insane battery life back then.You could phone would last for days.Right.You know, because like the phones now, they just have so much electronics and this beautiful screen and high resolution is doing things, you're playing games on it and you're taking pictures, you're battery, but still, you're battery's good for like a day.That was this shit.I had one of those, I thought I was in space.Well, I also liked the little side saddle.Did you have the holster on your belt?I tried that, I couldn't do it.I felt like such a dork.And it's coming from a guy where's a fanny back?Yeah, right.And you like to play with guns, you have guns.I don't play with guns, sir.But this phone right here for me was the fucking shit.I could never imagine seeing somebody with one of those today.[1:18:00] I would be like, what are you doing with that thing?But aren't they bringing them back?Dev at everyone.But the new one is like a new phone.It's like a modern phone.The new one folds.Yeah, I got that.But it has like apps.It's essentially a regular phone.Yeah.But it does close and it's real slim.Like look, it looks pretty similar.Oh, I think you might open it up.Would you do it?I thought about switching to Android just because I don't like being trapped in the Apple ecosystem.I don't like the idea of it but Google does a lot of like really shady stuff with with there's there's different things they do that I don't like and one of the things they do is, like if you look at, what was their most recent declaration, they were talking about censoring things in a time of social problems.Remember that, Jamie?They would reserve the right to censor information [1:19:01] under certain circumstances.Some of the Google ads though, didn't it?It had something to do with Google ads, yeah.There's things that I don't like in terms of search results, curation, because that's the thing that Google does, that Robert Epstein has been working on for a long time, like showing that when you, like say, if you Google a presidential candidate, right?If you Google a candidate that's Democrat you'll get You know especially someone who they want to win you'll get like a lot of positive stories that come up first And you have to go deep if you want to find something about corruption or accusations or anything like that Yeah, but if you do Google or a public in it'll go right to that now I'm not saying this is just an example.I'm not saying you could find that.But his research shows this and I'm doing a bad job of paraphrasing it because they don't remember exactly what it said.But essentially his claim was that in curating search results, you can have an impact on elections.In curating search results and putting positive things for the people that you want to be elected in the prominence of the search result.[1:20:06] If it's not an organic search result, if you actually are curating it, you can affect the way people feel about candidate and that will affect the election results.Okay.And so that's an issue, that's Google.Yeah, yeah.So I have an issue with that and Google is answering.I agree, I hate that.But I also have an issue with the Apple Waldgarden.And I think there's a lawsuit going on right now about that, whether we're trying to get people to, you know, because of eye message and, you know, FaceTime and all this stuff, doesn't work on other phones.Oh, right, right, right.FaceTime does sort of, but you have to take a few steps and that's a new thing.A new thing is like if you FaceTime someone on an Android phone, they have to take a few steps to do it.Okay.I wonder how that works.I've never tried that.Have you ever tried that?I haven't tried it.Let's try it right now.Okay.FaceTime Brian Simpson.Okay.FaceTime Brian Simpson.I'm in a FaceTime OJ Simpson.Yeah, it gives you like a What's that?It thought it thought we're really asking [1:21:08] I should reach out to them Is it it didn't give me a link to send where's the link?I think it's up on the top like with the other buttons are no pull off so I didn't work So I have to how do I do it if I want to send him a text?Face time Brian Simpson face time OJ Simpson How do I do it if I want to send him a text?FaceTime Brian Simpson.FaceTime O.J.Simpson.Okay, send.What the fuck, you piece of shit?Oh, wow.What's this?It hurts rent a car.Hold on, be quiet for a second.Well, shut the fuck up.Well, FaceTime Brian Simpson.Okay.All right, I said join my FaceTime Brian Simpson Okay, all right.It said join my FaceTime all right.I sent it to him.Let's see if it works So let's see what he has to do who's Brian Simpson.He's a hilarious stand-up comedian That is performing tonight the comedy mother ship.Oh also he [1:22:01] Just released a special on Netflix.That's amazing.Wow.That he filmed at the mothership.So it says invite scent.We should call him and tell him what's going on.Who Brian?Yeah.Okay, this is just holding me up here.It's not done.Call Brian Simpson.All right, here we go.Hello.Hey, brothers, Joe.I'm on a podcast right now.You're live on the podcast with Harlem Williams.We were talking about how Apple keeps people from being able to use certain features like I message and FaceTime and I was saying that you can FaceTime someone that has an Android phone but there's a bunch of steps they have to take.I don't know how to do it.So we're trying to figure out how to do it.I'm gonna FaceTime you right now, okay?All right, I'll FaceTime you in like two seconds.[1:23:01] Bye.Cool.FaceTime Brian Simpson.All right, I sent him, joined my FaceTime.Let's see how that works.So here it goes.We'll see how this feature works.Now, and I know all you Android doorks, I know that there's other shit that you could use to do this like WhatsApp.And I guess you could use Instagram, right?Don't people use Instagram for video calls?This is not so fluid.Yeah, if I wanted to FaceTime you, because you're a little Apple fanboy over there, you're a little bootlicker.Hell yeah, yeah.I could just FaceTime you.I'll let that do you part.And it would work instantly.See, he's got this invite.Yeah.This takes so long.Like it ruins the spontaneity about a fun FaceTime call.A fun FaceTime call you're at a concert.Dude, what's up?Look where we are.And ironically, his initials are BS because this is BS.This is bullshit.Yeah.This is like straight bullshit.Would you ever shoot your cell phone [1:24:02] like just to get your friends to like with a full high powered rifle?Yeah, we used to take them out to the range and shoot hard drives and cell phones.No, that's a good way to get rid of stuff Boom 300 wind mag at a hundred yards.Oh, it's amazing what it does to a cell phone.Oh Do you line it up in a scope?Of course.Yeah, I can't see that far.Wait, how far?Actually, 100 yards.Wow.Yeah.There's a video of it, I think, that didn't red band have a video?Yeah, we made a video.Yeah.Did you ever shot a machine gun?Yes.And?Elation?Um, it's kind of interesting.It's scary.It says I'm waiting to be let in.This piece is shit.Yeah, I forget it.I'm gonna tell him forget it.Yeah.What is it doing here?It says join.Is it working?Waiting for others.No, this is a more shit.It doesn't work.I'm telling forget it, bro.[1:25:03] So, bitch.See, but this is the thing that people are complaining about.Yeah.That it forces people to think you're a fool for having an Android phone.So you just go out and get an iPhone and iPhones have dominated the market because of that.Yeah.So, like, I think the numbers are with young kids, the numbers is like, it's something like 80-something percent of kids have iPhones.Yeah.So the kids that don't have iPhones, they get left out of iMessage group chats, they get taut shit too.Oh, you poor, you got an Android phone.Yeah, it's a class thing.It's a class thing.It's weird.It's a weird thing.I don't like it.What do you think the evolution of cell phones already?I think it's like neuro-length where we're just like, you know, we're thinking our communicative thoughts or what's your thought on that?Yeah, 100% or really?Yeah, that are awareable.Maybe something that like you wear and it touches your temples.[1:26:00] Right, because the concept that we're, we're back so as saying about flight Mm-hmm like wait you guys carried these boxes around and yeah, held them to your head Yeah, well, I mean just this alone was magic a hundred years ago if you brought this a hundred years back People would think you're the craziest wizard.Oh, yeah, I have the answers to all questions Yeah, oh my god people in 2024 must be so smart and they come to play to like a magic convention.Yeah.You see Robert DeNiro getting yelled at and look, he's doing a fucking press conference.He'll never leave.Like, what is this?What is he point?This is to I don't know, but this is people in 2024.Whereas if you gave this to people in 1924, they're like, there's no way everyone will have the world solved.Once they have these, oh my god, then they have all the information.And then people will know exactly what everybody looks like.There'll be no more catfish.Still chaos.Well, and now there's filters that you could use where I, from just a small snippet of your [1:27:01] conversation on this podcast, I think they need about 30 seconds, 30 seconds of your voice.And then I could pretend to be you, like just talk like this and the audience would see you with what you're wearing, the way your hair is, everything in your voice.So everything that I say, like me saying this right now, it would be you saying this right now.Your voice, your face, your body, everything looks like you, all through AI.Whoa.So there's no fucking way to know what anybody is saying that's not true.And then there's a big issue right now with celebrities, especially women, they're making porns with them.Oh, they're, they're, they're, they're, they just change.Super imposing like like, like, celebrities face on.Oh, they're they're they're they're they just changed super imposing like like Celebrities face swap with AI So this porn stars having sex with this person you face swap Natalie Portman or fucking Angelina Jolie and now you have a a real [1:28:05] Realistic looking sex tape of famous people getting fucked so I I could see Judge Judy plowing the pizza.Judge the boy just sucking cock like it's going out of style.Like the closing sale.Wow, imagine Judy Dent in a pool boys video.That's Judy Dent.Remember the British actress?I do not.M from what's her name?Dent.Judy Dent.Bench.Dent.the British actress.I do not.Am from what's her name?Judy, Dinch.Bench?Dinch?Oh, there she is.Imagine her in a pool boy.Oh, she was so hot.Oh, no.She was young.She's so pretty.No, I mean, now.But look at her, what's her name?She's so pretty.Imagine her rubbing chlorine all over a pool boy.Time is a ruthless bitch, isn't it she puts the net over his head.I'm trying not to imagine I'm trying to power through this She's 89 years old give the woman her do give her her respect son of a bitch.How about I give her a check for clean in the pool Wow getting stuck in the dryer Whoa, so looking for something I can pull me pull me I can't get out [1:29:01] Stuck in the dry is my favorite you've seen the dryer porns are my favorite because it's so ridiculous.You can get out of the dryer, like anyway, did you?I love it when they've told her.I was pretty big.When they pulled her head out and there's a cling-free sheet on their head.Yeah.They got a mouth full of lint.Looks like they've been blowing an elf.Yeah.I was stuck in here.Thank you for saving me.You know what, I tried the dryer sex once and I accidentally, I was so impassioned, I hit the tumble cycle.Oh wow.And so imagine being in your woman and she starts swirling around and you're holding on like a horse, a rodeo horse.It was some of the best sex I've ever had.Did you stay still while she spun?That would be the moon.She spun.I just held onto her muffin top.And we swirled around like, Did you get any concussions?She did.Yeah.Holy God.We're not banging around there.Oh, her head came out.She looked like this cauliflower.But I had one of the best orgasms I've ever had in my life.That's a one-time deal, right?It's hard to trick her into doing that again.[1:30:05] Well.I'm a women-like adventure.Yeah.What's the weirdest place you've ever done it?Your house.That was you?Wow.Thought I heard that dog growling under the bed.Errrr.Yeah, I was doing it under the bed.Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr One time we got eaten up by mosquitoes, like our whole body, both of our bodies is covered in mosquitoes.So we're so retarded, we got naked in the woods in July in Massachusetts.Wow.Yeah, but you're fucking 17, you know what I'm doing?You're crazy.Wild kids.A lot in the woods?Yeah, well, there was always, [1:31:00] woods were always there.Now, there was a place when you were kids, you could just go to the woods, get out and just bring a tower or blanket or something.Just a lot of woods.Yeah, but the woods are scary, because anything in the woods is scary.Things in the woods become scary, even if they're not scary anywhere else.Like a baby, a naked baby in the woods, just staring at you.It's fucking terrifying.There's no other place where a naked baby is scary.Like if you walk it out of the street, you see a naked baby like, oh my god, whose baby is this?Does anybody know whose baby is it?He's a little guy, hold on.And then you'll call the police, pick up the baby, and the woods are like, we're gonna die!It's a fucking naked baby, just tear it at us.If it's hanging upside down from a red pine, tear it Red pine staring at you.That's pretty creepy.Yeah holding on by its feet.Yeah, a bag.Yeah, if you saw a baby in the woods Just staring at you fucking terrifying.Yeah any other place But baby so the woods are automatically scary.Yeah, it's you're scared that you're gonna get caught So that's exciting.Yeah, we're not gonna get caught.Don't worry.We're gonna go deep in the woods [1:32:01] What about the city though?You ever do it in a crazy place in the city?Not really you.Sewers?You ever go in the sewer?You ever go in a manhole?How a little farmhouse?In a ferris wheel once.Really?Yeah.Whoa.You were worried you were gonna be at the bottom and wouldn't be able to stop?Well that was cool.We would time it so that when we came down, it was like hands off and then we'd swirl.So it was like kind of this really fun sort of start and stop thing.And then one time I'm not kidding, the guy sort of recognized me and we were having the guy here, the carny who ran it, like when I got, oh dude, I love you, right?And so we were having so much fun, but we weren't finished.And so as he was letting everyone off, I said, just leave us on, just please, just go, okay, I got you.And we just like finished swirling.Yeah.Congratulations.Did you ever do it in the swirling teacups at Disney Land?Imagine if you did.[1:33:01] How?Boy, imagine throwing it up right when you come.I feel amazing.Because even though throwing up sucks, it feels amazing when you have to throw up and you finally do.It's purging.Oh, you know that feeling?Like last time I threw up was about a year ago and it was in the middle of the night.I got up and I was like, I feel like I'm going to fucking puke.Yeah.I just I didn't feel good going to bed and in the middle of the night I was like whoa and I woke up and I got Went into the bathroom to pee or throw up and I was like oh boy.They might both happen at the same time Oh, and I held the pee Yeah, just like yeah, and then I peed right over my throw up.I don't give a fuck dude.Wow.That's how wild wow I didn't even but much I just pissed on the throw up.I just left it.Yeah.Surf from turn.Just a little throw up.Did you do the thing when you barfed, like, right after you just curled up on the bathroom floor in the fetal position and felt the cool tiles on your naked skin?Never done that.[1:34:00] Me either.I do lay down on the bathroom floor sometimes when I get out of the sauna though.Oh yeah.Cause this tile floor, like right when you get out of the sauna, it's 185 fucking degrees or whatever it is.Yeah.I like to lay down that cool.Can you do the ice soaking?Yeah, I'm gonna be inside my house.I'm inside my house.Oh yeah.I'm gonna be inside my house.I have one outside too.I'd love to come over later and sit in it with you.Yeah, we got one here too.We got one here.I'd rather do the one at your house, I think, then you can have dinner too.Okay, what do you want to sleep over?I want mine.I bet you do.Well, we're gonna work out in the morning.No.You can.You gonna gonna get the cold plunge?No.Come on.I'd sit nice cream.In a hot day, the cold plunge feels good for about five seconds.Yeah.Hot day, you get in there like, oh fuck.I jumped in Lake Superior once and it was one of those things.I probably stayed in about five minutes [1:35:01] and I've never experienced it, but when I got out for about 40 minutes after I was shaking, it was so cold.Here's a question.Lakes appear, massive lake.Used to have glacier, right?Yeah.Okay.Biggest of the Great Lakes.Most of North America, at one point in time, at least half of North America was covered by like a mile high sheet of ice.Okay.So you have this time period after the ice age where all that melts.How the fuck do the fish get in there?Yeah.How the fuck do those fish get in there?It's a mystery.That's a really good question.How those lake trout get in there in the middle of the country.Yeah.It's big ass giant lake trout.How the fuck did they get in there?What did they just evolve once the water melted?Yeah.Where there were their seeds of the fish, and the ice waiting to be melted?For real though.Yeah.That's all ice.Yeah.The fish ain't getting in there.How did they get in the middle of the lake?The lake is fucking huge.It's filled with fish.There is a possibility, it's an extreme one, but I'm trying to answer your question, [1:36:06] that a predatory bird, like an osprey or a gall or some kind of fish eating bird flies from the ocean, caught a fish in a local river or a nearby lake.But Jason, too.Where are those nearby lakes if the entire continent is covered in ice?Yeah.Well, have you ever been to a, like a farm or anything like that?And sometimes they have those water troughs that they leave out for the cows, but they've been abandoned.Or you come to a place where there's like a little puddle in a field or something.Right.And somehow there's fish in it.And there's there's there's no noots and there's aquatic creatures.And you go, how did they get here?How did a noot get up an aluminum bin and get down into this ecosystem that's evolved here?It's fascinating.[1:37:02] Your question kind of raises the questions for all of creation.It's, we can look at evolution, we can look at the dawn of time, but it's really, is it ever been answered?Not totally.I mean, they don't have an exact time by time, like day by day timeline.But do they have an answer to how fish got into the great legs?I can't believe I never asked that before.I never even thought of it before.This is a huge body of water of course there's fish in there but if the whole content was covered 10,000 years ago in ice what the fuck happened?Well you might have to say okay somewhere there was a tributary that came to be from the ocean.No, it would be from north.It would be from up north.Right, but where the fish come from from that?Hudson's Bay down into superior and the ocean fish.Maybe you probably swim upriver from the warm areas.Well, that's what salmon do.[1:38:00] Yeah, about they swim up area.That makes the most sense when they got in those lakes.So those lakes must be connected to rivers, right?Oh yeah, I have to have to be there.So they probably swim up into the lake and then evolve to become like these big lake creatures like lake trouts.Yeah.Cause lake trouts are fucking huge.Lake trouts can get huge.Oh man.Yeah.People ice fish them.Yeah.That's like a big way of it.They're fucking crazy looking.Yeah.So that thing, you don't really find them, I mean, in the southern areas, right?Those are in northern fish, aren't they?Lake trout?Yeah.They're sort of a deep water, really cold fish.And they don't necessarily have to be way up north.Right.So if they evolved, so these lakes and streams from the lower part of the country.Yeah.Right?So if you're talking about like New Mexico or something like that, what, some area that wasn't covered in ice, these things swim all the way up the river and then they evolve in this lake to become bigger and to become adapted to the cold, deep water.[1:39:00] Different species.Yeah.It's crazy.This is the mystery of crazy where we are.Yeah, and this is about sturgeon where they're like dinosaurs come from these things are what the thousand pounds or more huge monsters.They look like dinosaurs prehistoric.They look prehistoric.Have you ever seen that thing that's in the Amazon that has it has essentially bulletproof scales?Yeah, they're black.What is it called?I've seen papaya.Yeah, what's up, Jim?Well, just the way the fish got into Great Lakes is a way deeper store than I've uncovered so far, but the way Sam and got there, specifically in the 60s.People brought them there.Yeah, a guy had to bring them there.Mm, that makes sense.Fishing became very popular back then.So a lot of dead fish swimming on the shores for some reason I was trying to find out.But were there any fish in there before the salmon?That's the, there had to have been, that's why I was trying to ask you.Right.I've seen this image recently, like the depth of Lake Superior specific.[1:40:00] Holy shit, very deep.I've fished that like 333 feet.Fuck.So there could maybe have been something under there waiting for the ice to melt that came back up.There's a bunch of stuff saying what he said to was like fish eggs get dropped by other birds and end up in the water.I got to think the river has a lot to do with it.But that was it.So this is like you can't go up Niagara Falls.That's true.Right?Right.Good.Yeah.Good point, Jamie.That's a very good point.Right?How the fuck does it get past those?God damn it.Well, the mystery.Yeah, this is the thing.We've maybe cracked or uncovered one of the biggest mysteries in humankind.And no one's talking about it, buddy.Yeah.Isn't that incredible?Yeah, aren't you glad I showed up?I busted it out.Wow.We're the ones.We're the ones.Imagine tomorrow, like front page every newspaper, Harlan Williams and Joe Rogan pose serious question as to how fish got in the Great Lakes, and scientists are baffled.And they also are talking to us, coming to us like, how did you guys realize that fish had to get into the great lakes when the [1:41:05] great lakes used to be covered in a glacier.You guys are geniuses, untouched geniuses of nature.And then maybe when Trump gets in for a second term, he appoints us to some sort of a nature advisory board and we give we can be the master ecthologists.Yes.We can be the people telling everybody how to fix all these problems with animals and people and but see here's the other layer of this lasagna that we're not talking about.You're talking about Lake Trout.Right.How about the Lake Superior probably has 60, 70 different species of fish.I fish Lake Superior.I've got white fish.I've got Lake Trout.There's all kinds of fish in there.Right.How they get in there?By the way, I used to work on the shores of Lake Superior.And there's a plate, you'd like this, because I know you like bears and you like guns and you like, there's a, believe it or not, there's a place on the shores of Lake Superior called Nays Provincial Park, where it's such a desolate place that a World War II, they had a German Nazi prisoner [1:42:06] of war camp on the shores.Whoa.And the prisoners, it was so remote, no one could escape, because they would have gone into the Canadian wilderness, but the German soldiers captured somehow a black bear and trained it to box.They put boxing gloves on it, and the Nazi soldiers for entertainment purposes would box with this black bear.Jesus Christ.And they sunk a whole bunch of wartime vehicles in Lake Superior.Wow.How many bounties do you think were in Lake Superior?I don't know, but they might be preserved at so cold.That's what I'm thinking.If you went down.Yeah, if you dropped them all the way to the 1,300 feet, just as creepy skeleton with his 1970s jeans on.Well, he might not even be a skeleton.That's what I'm saying.It's so cold, he might still have flash and just be like your baby in the woods.Just like, hi, Joe.[1:43:01] Would you like a you like some cauliflower?Don't you think something would eat them?Maybe more lamprey eels.This thing's alive down there.Lamprey.You ever seen a lamprey?They're saltwater creature.No, fresh water.They're in Lake Ontario.Oh really?Yeah.I know they're cleaned the bottom of sharks a lot.They feed off of what they show.Those are remoras.Oh, that's right.Ramoras by the way.The lamprey similar to a lamprey is one of the more horrific it has a round it's like an eel with a round suction cup with circular like buzz saw teeth.It affixes itself on the fish and slowly sucks their interiors out.Jesus Christ look at what if that was in a movie you would say oh my god.Yeah.Glad that's not that's like doing right that's like the worm and doing there is a movie what's a call let me see that one where they do hold it again that's so crazy yeah the land crack fucking mouth man well what's what's amazing is it sucks your insides out and slowly each you alive so it pulls the skin apart and then just sucks out.No, it literally creates [1:44:06] a hole.Look at it biting that dude's hand.Yeah, it puts a hole in the fish and just stays a fix to the same spot and eats its insides out.They're older than dinosaurs.Yeah.Now they're in there in like in the great lakes.That's crazy.How the fuck did they get in there?So that's one attached to a fish?Yeah, that's on a lake trout right there.Can you show me that picture, the photo?Oh, so that's the hole where it was right there.No, that's it hanging.Invasive.Oh, those are the ones hanging.Yeah, and then see the hole.You can see a hole where one let go.And they just, they just Please consume the fish.Where are they from originally?It says it's an invasive species.I don't know, maybe the Amazon.Does it say?Wow.Right, right, but where are they from?It says it's invasive.It's a sea lamprey.Yeah.They're in the great legs.[1:45:01] The sea lamprey is invasive, and it can cause problems in the local ecosystems.It's a lot to do with its size.Sea rampant are big compared to native species.So it comes from the ocean somehow or another.And they can live in fresh water?That's crazy.Well, apparently the girl, I think her name is Maria Bell, was the first person to ever swim across Lake Ontario.And she had to swim through schools of those, apparently, when she swam across Lake Ontario and she had to swim through schools of those apparently when she swim across Lake Ontario.Oh my god, imagine those little fuckers grab a hole in your asshole?Yeah, they're the perfect, they almost got assholes suckers for mouths.Like they're perfect.I hate to see Demetri around one of those.So in the 19 fishes, the US and Canada teamed up for population control measures and they have worked several strategies including traps to capture adult lampries, lamprisks to, pressed to, lamprisksize, poison, target sea lamprey larvae and installing barriers or fut tactics to use.So for working, [1:46:01] what's this saying?That's a good thing.Left multiple IC lampries can significantly damage the region's $7 billion fishing industry.Oh, lampries.Creepy little fuckers.Yeah, and then the Ramora.Yeah, where that thing is.The Ramora has a suction cup on its head.So the top of its head is a suction cup.Look at that.And I was sexually assaulted in Florida.I had been eating a bacon sandwich and spilled some on my lap and went swimming and that thing sucked me for about an hour and a half.Look at that top of its head.Well, someone's not paying attention.I'm paying attention.Why does sexual assault and you glazed your joint over?I didn't believe you?Well, it's the last it too long.I can show you the suck my like 30 seconds.I said, oh my god, that thing clung to his leg for 30 seconds.But I maybe I wanted to last remember you're talking to the dryer sex guy here.Right.The guy with the the baby.Do you know that the Spanish is a sucker fish latches to swimmer?[1:47:00] Whoa.There you go.Let's say it's hot.But you know the Spanish fisherman, you know, there was a time when you could eat sea turtles.Right.And the Ramora will swim to whatever's moving because they feed off of, they're like parasitic fish when the shark eats, they'll catch all the scraps.So Spanish fishermen, to their ingenuity, they used to eat sea turtles.And when they'd catch a remora, they'd keep it alive in the boat.And when they saw a sea turtle, they'd put it on their line, throw it in the water.The remoras would go to the sea turtles, stick on the shell, and they'd reel in sea turtles.It used to be able to eat them, yeah.That's how they get...No, you're making this up.No, that's for real.This was in the past.They clung to the sea turtle, and that's how they pulled this.They used it like a magnet to the sea turtle.Yeah, you saw the size of the sucker on its head, right?So it would stick to the sea turtle, and then they could, Pull in the yeah see there's Yeah, so if you want to go fishing for sea turtles later let me know that's crazy.Yeah [1:48:09] Some good suck and going on in the ocean they should take the sea turtles and flip them on their back and put them in the bottom of the ship And then when they wanted to eat one they just pick it up because if you flip them on their back They can't turn over so they just lay there.Yeah, and they could stay alive for a long time without food or water.Yeah, because they're herb-breather's.Yeah, so you just leave them in there.So you want a quick one?Yeah, throw a leave over it.Pick it up.It's like fresh food.I've seen a bunch of videos of people cooking and eating sea turtles in other countries, because there's like some cooking show or fishing show or some guy went with American, you're not allowed to kill sea turtles.But in some parts of the world, like their local culture, you know, like in some like some uscoblaces.Yeah, inuits are allowed to eat whale.They can kill whale, they can kill walrus, seals, all that stuff.So these people are allowed to kill sea turtles, but there's something like really disturbing [1:49:00] about watching a sea turtle get hacked apart.Yeah, because they're so gentle.I know, and there's like, what is happening?Yeah, they're just like little dummies when we're having a fish.Like a fish, fish is just like their eyes don't move that good.They just move around a little.You're so removed from me, I'm gonna cut your head off and serve you a sushi.They're so sweet.That's cute.Also sea turtles.Trying to seem tough, but turtles are always good guys.Yeah.In movies and like Ninja Turtles, they're the good guys.Yeah.Right?Turtles are like your friend.Yeah, they're buddies.Yeah, they're your wives, pal.The turtles never cuts.It's never really a country turtle.Mm.In like movie There you are wise pal, the turtles never cuts.It's never really a country turtle.In like movie depictions.Yeah.Do you think of a country turtle?God.Remember that giant turtle that fought Godzilla and he like fired up out of his skull?There he goes.There's a big old fly.He was sped around.[1:50:01] What was his name?Cunti?No.I don't think so.But like turtles, that's like one of those things that happens with people.That's why people love bears.Because you have teddy bears.You have teddy bears and you got yogi and only you can prevent forest fires, all that stuff.Bears are your friends, they're sweet.It's what a great PR campaign.These murderous assassins have pulled off.Yeah.Getting us to like reintroduce them into areas where people are like, what are your friends?They're not.They're monsters.Big ass monsters.With a good PR campaign.Polar bears a leech a fast, doesn't know, do anything else.Here's a fact.Owls are dumb.I thought they were wise.I did too.I talked to a woman who trains birds.And she had all these different birds.She had hawks and parrots and falcons.She said owls are the dumbest.There's only one animal, dumber than them.That's one of those big animals, one of those big birds rather that's dumber than them.[1:51:01] One of them big birds from Australia.What are those things called?E-View?That's it.That one's dumber.Really?So that's the only animal that's dumber than an owl.It's just like owls are so dumb.I thought they were wise.I had one going outside of my house about two weeks ago.Keep them awake all night.And I'm like, how throw a Rubik's cube up into the tree.It comes back 30 seconds later perfectly done.So I don't think they're that dumb.Wow.I had to be getting autistic kid, living in your tree.Yeah.Johnny, I'm trying to sleep.Come down, Johnny.He's up there counting out loud.So check this out Joe He's not doing long map in his head.He's up there eating celery.I thousand divided by 16 Beautiful mine [1:52:01] Throws it back to you.He keeps going on with his math.I did do a movie once where I played a wizard and I had a Eurasian Eagle Owl.I think they're the biggest of all the owls.And they trained it to land on my arm on the big leather glove.Yeah.And I'd never worked with owls up close like that.And the trainer, he was sitting like this with his talons and The trainer said grab the back talon and pull it and I said well, I don't I don't want to hurt the thing You know I see see said no pull it so I I grabbed the back and I you know I gave it a tug and it didn't move and he goes no pull it as hard as you can and you know These are these big claws.I grab it.I could not where does you can?And you know, these are these big claws.I grab it, I could not move it.And he goes, this is what an owl's death grip feels like.When it clanks onto something, it's over.I could not believe the strength in that towel on it.It was crazy.Yeah, I mean, they're raptors.[1:53:00] Yeah.They're just wild.They're claws.When you see an eagle's claw, when they give you a close-up, and you look like that, it's like a human hand, but with spears of the fingers.But I didn't understand the strength of them.It's just like, much stronger than your hands.Yeah.Well, imagine what they do when they just snatch a salmon out of the water and fly away with it.I tried it.I tried it.I mean, that's insane.I mean, that is straight up dinosaur tools.Look at that.That's crazy.Look at all the texture to it, all the muscles and teeth.What a monster.And way more powerful than you would think just by looking at it.Oh yeah.I actually, if you look at the claws of the osprey, look at that, owls.Those are fake.He's got two hands, bro.That's real.No, those are real.No, that's the wise owl.That's the real wise owl.That can't be.I don't know what they're doing.He reads books with those.Yeah.He's up there in the tree reading books.I think it's the problem with that first thing.What's wrong with that?Oh yeah.[1:54:05] Look up to the internet.but I was so shocked that owls are dumb.Yeah, why did it?Whoa, look at those claws.Is that the Eurasian eagle owl?Oh my god.Great horn.Great horned owl.Look at those things.That's so amazing.That's what took my Chihuahua.Did it really?Yeah, I had a Chihuahua and one of those bastards because they're big too.Oh, those are fairly big.So they get a lot of cats.Imagine my little Chihuahua getting picked apart by that friend.Wow, I have a friend and he was telling, I think Steven L.was telling us on the podcast, was he about the, like they found this one owls nest that was filled with like cats, little collars.Oh wow.Yeah, it was like 30 different cat colors.Oh yeah.It's on like that.Yeah, that's what.Yeah, that's what.The Vuntman, they just snatching cats out of people's back.Yeah.And like I said, it's a tabby.Yeah.Trap right there.Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss If you hear this, if you hear, whew!And there, yeah.You ever heard like the difference between the sound [1:55:07] and the owl makes when it flies, they've done like these, like with they record the noise.There is no sound.It's insane.But silent.When you see a hawk do it or an eagle do it, there's all those different, different birds have noise and the owl makes like no fucking noise.The aerodynamics of an hour they're like stealth bombers.Yeah, just silent.You know the other wild one is tuna When tuna goes through the water they can go through the water to grab someone and and grab something and they don't even make a ripple Like when they go over the tail of the wall.It's crazy.I watch video of it.It's busy when they jump Yeah, no when they're going through the top of the water.Oh, I slide through like a night.Yeah So that's a hawk.Yeah when they're going through the top of the water, you just slide through like a night.Like a night, yeah.So that's a hawk.Yeah.I know what's the owl.It's Ken's his too.Shhh.[1:56:01] Nothing.Silent.Silent.Silent nighttime killer.Nothing silent silent night time killer Dumb is shit big stupid head with giant eyes dumb is shit just fucking killing everything again Other than that dumb are they gonna be smarter than a woodpecker?I think woodpeckers are way smarter really.I don't know.What about a blue hair?I don't think you'd train a woodpecker's this lady probably has a limited Database to work with.Everything like she's got on her arm is like a raptor, except for the owl.Like the Falcons, she said the hardest.Hawks and Falcons, she goes, they just kill everything.Like you let them go, they just go find things, they'll kill squirrels, they just like, they're killing machines.She goes, I let them go, they just find things and kill it like immediately.Find a bird, kill it, fly up to the bird, kill it.They come back to her, but they just go kill things first.Oh, this is a trained phallic.Yeah, yeah, this is what they're all trained, but it doesn't matter.Like if you let a hawk go, hawks just go we got to kill?They just fly around like what?Oh bird.Yeah, boom, dead.[1:57:05] They're not even trying to eat it.Squirrel, fuck you, bam.Kill that squirrel.So sport killing.Sport killing.Really?They're just designed to kill.Because not a lot of animals do that.Some animals can't help themselves.Lions do it to hyenas.Yeah, but I bet that lion did it to that lady in that car, I bet she was neat now.I bet that was a little bit of sport.There's another old video where some like Danish guys going through a lion safari with his wife and kids, and he got out, he was with his camera, and literally the kids and the wife, you see them in the car, going, but his legs are kicking in the air, and the lion just came and devoured him right in front of the wife and kids.Like the idiot got out.Some people are just fucking stupid.Yeah.That's Darwin, right?Yeah.That's the whole idea.It's like those people are not supposed to make it.Yeah.You're not supposed to make it.But they've already breed.Brad.That's a problem.[1:58:00] Yeah.At least the that has the benefit of seeing his dad get, like my dad was so dumb.Like you know, you can have a dumb dad and get through things and be a different person than your dad was.And if you're a dumb kid and your dad is dumb as shit, your dad gets out and gets eaten by a lion in front of you, that has a profound effect.I gotta be honest though.Not even saying that kid's dumb or that, you know, maybe the kids are genius.Yeah.You could be, you could have a genius kid, be stupid.I gotta be honest though, Joe, in this world we live in, where, you know, humans expire primarily, you know, in a hospital bed or at home and round their loved ones, with a disease, with whatever cancer.Right.I really would rather die, like jumping a lion.Like, you know, at the family function, how do you die?He attacked a lion.He went out on his shield.Huh?Yeah, you went out on your shield.Yeah.Like I want to noble the death of like a warrior, right?[1:59:00] Yeah.And going back to that story, this is gonna sound ridiculous.No way.Yeah.And I'll go back to that story.This is gonna sound ridiculous.No way.Yeah.But going back to the story where I told you, I saw the line when my hand was shaking.There was that terrified part of me.This is for real.There were two male lions, no one else in the middle of Africa.Part of me wanted to jump out of the truck and just run it the lion and attack it, knowing that I die, but knowing that it would be the most glorious death of a man with courage or stupidity, but at least I would die in a fashion where...In the real world, organic nature, man versus beast, beast versus beast, because I don't like to think of us as superior to other creatures, but it just...That actually popped into my head.I thought, I don't wanna expire in the leukemia ward.[2:00:04] I don't wanna be a hospice't want to expire in the leukemia ward.I don't want to be a hospice.Right.I've lived a good life.Yeah.So imagine I just run it alive.And that last moment I get to see the shock in its face of a human daring to jump on it and grab it.Yeah.And they would have been on me in a second, but I don't know.Is that weird?No.Like, have you ever thought how you wanna die?Well, if you're gonna die, especially if you're older and you know it's soon, what do you say?Just run at that line.What if, have you ever thought about that?No.Would you be fine just expiring in a hospital bed?Yeah, that's better than being torn apart in front of your family Yeah, I'm not saying do about your family People that know I'm from your family, but if you just have to get one at one moment like to take you to the line Let's say you're out hunting a gris and one day you just go you know what you put the rifle down and you just run out [2:01:02] I'm gonna go Hmm.This is how I want to go.Punching, punching a gris in the face.No one you're gonna die, but you go out in that wild...Punching a gris in the face is like an ant punching you.So like being attacked by a kitten with no claws.It is.But you get that moment of being a man, of feeling that power.You'd rather just, that's a stupid way to do it.Have a heart attack.Yeah.Who's Kai?That's a stupid way to die.Well, I mean, it's one thing if you get attacked by an animal when you're out in the woods.And it's like, hey, this is the price you pay for being in nature.But see that's the thing you're avert they attack us Why can't we attack them now flip it around?I like you yeah, okay, maybe I'm even inviting you to come with me to do it If you ever find out that you're gonna die and that's how you want to go I'll go you come with me Yeah, definitely I'll bring a rifle in case you change mine [2:02:05] You wouldn't like as you're running like Joe change my mind boom.I'll have my cross hairs on him You wouldn't run to the animal with me.No, no, I'll be there to watch I'm sorry to I love that okay.It would be a special moment with share I love share I'll be there when you pass over into the next stage of what and but you got to do me a favor Yeah, if like Heaven's real if like there is an afterlife, or whatever it is, just let me know.Oh, I would.Come back and tell me.Come in a dream.Tell me in a dream.Yeah.If you've got a dream of someone who died, and it seemed like super realistic.Oh.Yes.I think I have.What was it?It might have been my dad.Ooh, yeah, I just remember being really sad, like he's gone and there was like this wave of emptiness.Because my mother did die.And are your parents still with us?Yes.So when my mother died, like this whole formed in my heart, [2:03:02] like it literally felt like a hole.And it can't close.Like I can come to peace with it.His whole form in my heart, it literally felt like a whole.And it can't close.I can come to peace with it.I can be at harmony with the fact that she's gone, but I wasn't even super close with my mom, but the whole that got left in my heart is like, if I focus on it, I can feel it immediately.And it's that connection to the mother, that the person that brought you into this world, you know, is really, really powerful.And so in the dream, what happened with your dad?I can't remember, it's foggy.What I remember more than the actual moment is that feeling, that feeling of emptiness, that, oh, they're gone, you know, just gone forever.And it was really sort of this sad, crushing feeling on my soul.It's powerful.I had a dream after Phil Hartman died.Oh.And it wasn't that long after his death and In the dream I [2:04:07] ran into him and it was very realistic Because we were outside and he had like one of those folding lawn chairs and it was on the ground and I said I said hello and He was explaining to me that him and his wife had worked it out.You know, this is after his wife killed him.Yeah.You were right there too, right?I wasn't there when it happened.No, but you were working the show and it happened, right?Yeah, yeah.And he laughed about it.Like, yeah, we had a lot to work through.But we're good now.Something along those lines.And then he sat down on the lawn chair and like fell backwards, like it stumbled backwards.And then I looked and he was gone.It was really weird.Cause then I realized it was a dream.And then I woke up.But I remember thinking, like in the moment, [2:05:01] like that seems so realistic.Like he was like telling me he's okay.Cause I tried to get him to divorce that lady a bunch of times.It was working with him.Yeah, cause he would, they would fight like crazy fights where he would just disappear for a couple.He would leave the house and he was telling me he wanted to get divorced, but he didn't want the lawyers to take a third.Because it's like, I was like just keep her.How about a half?No, no, no, it's two thirds.So the lawyer takes a third.This is what he was telling me.It's like I go just give her half.You're always gonna make money.Just get out.Be free.Just be here.And he was terrified of that.He was terrified of leaving.And so when he finally decided to leave, she murdered him sleep.She shot him and then she shot herself and my friend was actually my friend who was a cop was actually there when she shot herself.Oh, so that happened when the police approached the house?Yes.Yes.Oh wow.Yeah.The police broke into the house to try to save the kids and she shot herself.The kids ran away from their mom.He told me so he told I hadn't he told I hadn't done stand up in two weeks after the murder.I was just, [2:06:06] yeah, I just couldn't imagine anything being funny.And then I decided two weeks later to try to go to the comedy store.So I'm at the gas station.And while I was at the gas station, my friend who was a cop was there.And I was like, Hey, what's up?How are you doing?He goes, Hey, how are you doing?You good?And I go, yeah, he goes, you know, I was there.I go really.And then he told me the whole story about how he was there and they saw the mom in the bathroom with the gun.And the kids ran away from the mom when the cops broke down the door because the cops saw her in the bathroom with the gun.And a lot of times in murder suicides, the mother will kill her children too.Yes, of course.Yeah.And so she was in there with the gun, talking to the kids, and the kids freaked out.And then when they broke down the front door, the kids ran away from the mom, and she just blew her brains out.The only good side is they didn't see her do that, I'm guessing.I'm hoping they didn't see that.There's no good side.I mean, there's no good side.You lose your mother and your father in a murder homicide in one night and you're like, what?You mean there's no good side.[2:07:07] With your intuition, like obviously you were advising Phil to get away.Was there ever a foresight in your head that she would murder him?Wow.No, no, no, no, no.That's funny how we just don't know people.But first of all, she was also on Zoloft and Cocaine.And the family won some sort of a settlement with Zoloft.Not much, but you, there's instances where people mix Zoloft with Cocaine that they have psychotic reactions.And I suspect that's what was going on.And she was, they hated each other.They loved each other and they hated each other.You know, it's one of those deals.Like she would insult him publicly.It was rough, man.And, you know, I was just saying, like you're a great guy.Like you don't need to be going through this.[2:08:01] Like you need to get divorced and have, you know, share custody of your kids and try to set an example and just not, you can't do this.Like the fighting was so bad.It was, and he hated it.He didn't want to be married to her.He was stuck and I told him, like you can't just stay stuck and just let these circumstances overcome your existence.Yeah, you know matter how hard it is you have to push through.So we had a break or we were done filming for a bit until we went back for the next season and one day I woke up and someone called me and told me and then I saw it on the news and it's just like what?And then everybody was calling everybody and we all got together.We're like fuck It's just so hard to believe it doesn't make sense.It's like yeah, how was he or buddy like were you friends with him off set Like did you chum around and stuff?Yeah actually took me up in his plane once [2:09:00] to Find where I wound up buying a house because I he goes, one of the cool things about flying is like I can show you, because he had gotten his pilot license while we were on the show together.And so he was always practicing that he bought one of these single engine planes.It was pretty cool.And so he said, you wanna come up for a flight?A flight I'll show you around.I'm like, yeah, let's do it.And so we flew around the valley and showed me all these different areas.And it's like, he was a great guy, man.Did you?Sweet, sweet guy.Given the turmoil in his relationship, were you privy to the knowledge that they had a gun in the house?No, no, no, I didn't do.Because you got a, when you're going through something bad with a spouse, I don't think it's good having a gun in the house because someone could flip like that, you know?I guess, yeah, that's a horrible thing to think.But I don't even know who's gun it was.I don't know anything, you know?I don't know if it was her gun.I don't know if you knew about the gun.I don't Yeah, but the dream the dream was so strange because the dream was like him letting me know he's fine It was he was Phil he was laughing [2:10:07] He was like he made some sort of a joke about his wife killing him and That we got through that now and then he sat down on the lawn chair and fell backwards like it slipped back And like I think I looked down at the ground and I looked at him and he was gone and That was like oh, this is a dream and then I woke up Did you feel like closure?Yeah.Weirdly.Weirdly.It felt like it was him letting me know not to freak out about it.Yeah, like let it go.Yeah.Dude, you're always going to freak out about it.You freak out about the kids.Yeah.The kids is a big one that you just can't imagine what it would be like if that was you, if you were a kid, and then also your mom shoots your dad and then shoots herself, and then it's public.It's not just that it's this thing that you have to deal with, it's the thing that everybody wants to talk to you about because the whole world knows about it because he was a famous guy.Yeah.Well, not only famous, but what really, he was loved, but what really kind of was hard to get your head around is you have this guy [2:11:08] who's an extreme comedy force, right?And you don't think of joyous sort of comedy people that elicit laughter and violence like that.And so the fact here is this funny sort of, ha ha ha guy that brought so much laugh and then that kind of ending, it's like it just doesn't fit.But not only that, it's like, when does the wife kill the husband with a gun?Yeah, how often is it?That's so rare.An execution style in the sleep.While sleeping, yeah.Oh my God.What must have been going through her head too?So loft and cocaine.Yeah.What's Zoloft?It's an antidepressant SSRI.Oh, yeah.Wow.Yeah, Google the results of the side effects of mixing Zoloft with cocaine.I think there's a few psychiatric medications [2:12:00] that you, if you mix with alcohol, or if you mix with cocaine, you get really crazy behavior.Like people just go off the fucking rails.Yeah.I don't know even how much control they have.I don't know what that feels like.Like what does that feel like?You're on Zolaft and Koke.You might be fucking a raving maniac.Yeah.You know?Did you get anything on that?So So long yeah, like just that name sounds like it's crazy time sounds like it's from the Star Trek Yeah, it sounds like it's like a planet The Zoloft are here.I went if they named it that to make it seem like it's super advanced like you're gonna take Zoloft Yeah, it's fucking yeah, It just sounds like nutty time.That's gonna fix it.Yeah.That's gonna fix it.Like if there was a legitimate happy pill that worked like that with everybody, they gave you like sort of like a low dose of MDMA all throughout the day.Yeah.It's probably a good thing for everybody.Yeah.[2:13:01] Well, this is my side effects.I'm mixed on that.Yeah.Because I think we were bioengineered to have what we have.And when you, on a daily basis, if you start tinkering with what the structure was, how it was already the architecture of the structure, I feel like it's not maybe necessarily a good thing.Taking cocaine and antidepressants can interfere with your medication's ability to balance the levels of neurotransmitters in your brain, making them ineffective and possibly worsening your symptoms.Essentially antidepressants are meant to correct any chemical imbalances that make contributed depression such as low serotonin.Cocaine, on the other hand, is abused to spike dope, when do you say abused?How about used, buddy?To spike dope amine and serotonin levels, producing an energetic and euphoric high.Although this rush of dope amine and serotonin makes them feel great for a few minutes, mixing anti-depressants in cocaine can produce serotonin syndrome, which is marked by symptoms like confusion, anxiety, fear, diarrhea, vomiting, seizures, and coma.Additionally, taking cocaine with other drugs also increases the individual's risk of [2:14:08] addiction.Chronic users often require cocaine addiction treatment and treatment for cocaine with withdrawal symptoms to recover.Is there zoloft, mixing zoloft and cocaine, psychotic behavior?Google that.Oh, there's God of it.Because I think that was something that like unlimited Numbers of people they had observed some like craziness.Yeah, that's poor guy, man.Sorry dude That's a traumatic story.That's a rough story But you know it happened 25 years ago or whatever it was still it's just like Crazy crazy to believe.It's hard to believe.You know, it's hard to believe that someone could do that to someone that they marry to that they have children with and that they love supposedly.Well, it's all, you would lose your mind that far that you would shoot them in the sleep.It's fucking, well, it's the Jimmy Hendrix, [2:15:02] Jim Morrison from the doors, you know, Janice Joplin syndrome.They were cut down.They left us with who knows what else to offer us.You know, like so many untold jokes, stories, moments like Phil Harman was obviously multi-talented as an actor too.He was an artist as well.He's a album cover.Like to see what would still cut.Because I think Denny get killed in his late 30s.Nice in his 40s.40s.I don't think he even made it on to set it alive until he was in his late 30s.That was like the thing of him was like he was a grinder for so long and he was so talented and just didn't make it until he did.And then everybody's like, oh my God, this guy's amazing.He was fucking great on news radio too.He's such a good actor.Comedic actor, so funny man.Such a good at delivering a line.Like, such a professional.And it was interesting because he came over from Santa and I live, which is like this really competitive like shitty environment.[2:16:00] They're sniping each other and having a terrible things to each other behind the scenes.They do.Yeah, you're telling me it was terrible.And so when he came to News Radio to the sitcom, which was opposite, everybody was very loose.Everybody was silly.We'd all go out drinking together.It was a good time.It wasn't any like weird shittiness.Oh, good.And he had it like a just.And so he would tell me about it.Like he's like the smoke a little weed.So I'd hang out with him and he'd smoke with him.This is back when I wasn't smoking weed.And he'd smoke a little weed.We'd talk about stuff and just like you hated being there.It was just all backstabbers.Yeah, I've heard that story at SNL.Yeah, they'll steal your ideas for your sketches.and Jim Brewer had horrible stories about that.He had sketch ideas and he'd put them in the spreadsheet and they could read the spreadsheet of what you were going to do the sketches on.So other senior writers would steal those sketches and say, we're doing something on them.And just like, fuck you, man.It was just like this constant battle.[2:17:03] And he said he had it with cast members, he had it with writers.And so Phil was like, ugh.That's not conducive for comedy.That's just the worst.Yeah, so worse for comedy.But that's like that really weak man, like backstabbing shit when they get power.That happens.And when they have too much power unchecked and no one's watching them and they get away with things like stealing younger writers' premises and it's all dog eat dog.Everybody's just trying to get to the top.But look, that's always been a part of stand up.Always been a part of comedy.It's like people stealing people's bits and the famous person steals them and the unfamous person's fucked and destroys their lives.You've seen it happen before?Has anyone ripped you off ever?Yeah, sure.A bunch of times.Yeah.Yeah, I confronted people and they told me they wouldn't do it again, then I heard they were doing it again.Like there's certain people that have always been bucking ears.Yeah.[2:18:00] They've always been joke, bucking ears.You know, it's a pro and you know, they don't have any friends those those people They have they sometimes have like Like a vampire familiar opening act.So there's opening act will go with them and they'll steal bits from them too There was a bunch of guys that got away with that before the internet rolled around There was there's a predatory type of comedian that would just Pote other people's premises and sort of rework them.They didn't have any.There was nothing that they did that was creative on their own.Everything was derivative of somebody else's work.Everything.I always heard and I'm sure he could do anything he wanted on his own volition, but I had always heard stories that Robin Williams was that guy.Yeah.Did you ever hear?I heard a lot of stories that he was that guy.Yeah, and I think Robin Williams was so like part of that Manic sort of style.It's like this constant need to have a bit about anything that you're talking about ever and Killing I think was more important and filling that hole inside of him was more important than anything [2:19:04] And so he would just do other people stuff if he didn't have anything to say.Did you get confronted by other communities?Oh yeah, yeah, there's a lot of stories.Kinnison got mad at him.Oh really?Yeah, yeah, yeah.He stole from Kinnison?Yeah, he stole from everybody.He stole from a lot of people.So it is true.I know he's heard that You ask any of those comics from back then, there's always instances of Robin going on a talk show and doing your bid or going on this and doing your bid.Yeah, doing your bid at a club.Yeah.With him, do you think it was because he was just so spontaneous?He was just like, puke it out or?There's no way.Yeah.You've had, I think he wanted to kill more than he wanted to be ethical.So at any cost, I will tell.And especially back then, when no one was really watching you other than comedians, like even up into the 2000s, like the men see a thing happen in 2007, right?Even then, they were more willing to side with someone who they thought was more profitable [2:20:01] than the truth about what is this person doing and how are they getting this material?This is pretty clear that they're plagiarizing.And if it's any other form of entertainment like music, like they'll bring it to court and you lose.And then all the money from those songs has to come to the original person because you copied their song.Like that's a classic thing.Happens in literature all the time.That woman who was the president of Harvard got busted plagiarizing.She's not a president of Harvard anymore.There's consequences always, but in comedy, it's always been self-policed.And so it's a weird thing that thing that people do, where they try to pawn off other people's bits as their own.That was, it was a, so it's a weird thing that thing that people do, where they try to pawn off other people's bits as their own.Like it's a vampire thing, because you're around all these creative people, and you're just stealing a little bit from this guy, a little bit from that guy, and people are scared of you.Did you ever put a guy up against the wall?[2:21:01] No, I didn't have to do that.How come?Because I just said things.Like you just verbally hate.Just say to me, man, don't do my fucking material anymore.You know that's my material.Yeah.Just like that.And you know, they're probably still going to do it unless you want to hurt them.But it's like the thing about those people is they always get caught and when they get caught, they, they, everything after that sucks.This is how you know if a thief is legitimately a thief.If they're being unjustly accused, they're always gonna come up with new material.They're always gonna be creative.They're always gonna have new great jokes because they're actually writing and working on it.But if it's true, what you see is an initial special or something or a few things they do that are really funny.And then you see this massive drop off in like the concepts that they talk about, the irony that they discover, they don't have any like legitimate points where you're like, wow, that is crazy.There's none of that.[2:22:00] It all goes away.And it becomes almost like a person doing an impression of the original successful person Yeah, because they have no creative in that now they're exposed So now they have to be really careful.So you see that with every thief you see a couple early like big specials or something Yeah, and then you see massive drop off Interorable performances after that.It's because they're not real.Yeah, I think I can think of a fair.They're parasites.That's what they are.They're vampires and they're stealing from artists.And they're tolerated a lot of times because they're very successful.And one of the creepy things they do is they start hiring people to work for them.Like they'll have a television show or something that will hire legitimate people to work for them.And those people now become like, they become like confidence.And so they kind of keep it under wraps.They try to like defend that person publicly.It's a very slick PR move for scumbags.And some of those people working for them could be writers that will steal for them too on their behalf.[2:23:00] That becomes a problem too.One of the things that we noticed in the early days of the store is that the guys who are thieves, their opening acts would become thieves.Because even if the opening acts had potential and some of them got out of it and actually became legit comics eventually, but they were seeing the shortcuts that this guy was taking, they were seeing this guy driving number 80s and they're like, I wanna take shortcuts too.This is how you do it.If you want to get by, this is my mentor.If that's your mentor, if your mentor is a buck in here.And you know, you like, okay, I guess this is a fucking, I thought it was an artist.I guess this is a doggy dog world.Eventually I'll stop stealing, but right now I gotta make it.Bad approach.Crazy.Kind of crazy.Did anyone ever approach you and say, hey Rogan, that's my bet a bit.No.I have had people approach me where I know that it wasn't their bit, and I know they were trying to steal a bit.Oh, really?One of the things that thieves will do is say, I actually do a bit on that too.Yeah.And you're like, that's really interesting.So I've been doing this bit for two years, and you've seen me do comedy.So what do we do in.You know there's those moments.That's a little kind of [2:24:08] poke the cage.Yeah.And then there's also like public events like some big thing that happens with everyone's gonna have a bit on it.You know like that summering, like you can't say hey I do a bit on the summer.The border wall.Yeah.Everybody's got to go down the border wall.This is like, there's certain things where it's just you know.But you just know, we know who's writing.We see them.We see them go up.You know, if you go to the mothership on any given night, someone's going to do a joke at the bombs.And then that joke, maybe next time they'll tweak it.You know, maybe they come up into the green room as many times it happened Well, one of us will say a joke.I'll say a joke I'm like this joke is just fucking I can't go anywhere with it I got I know there's something there, but I can't and we'll fuck around we'll bounce off each other We'll network yeah, and then like someone will go up with the version of it.That's like tightened up And then it starts killing yeah, we, it works.And so it's like this cooperative project.[2:25:05] But it's just, if you're not doing that, then you're not creating new material because new material's never perfect.It's always, sometimes it is, sometimes you have a bit, like, every now and then, came to you, and it's hilarious right away, and it kind of stays in that same form.But then a lot of times, you know there's something there, but you don't know how you're going to extract it.Yeah.Some of my favorite moments is I'm one of these guys.I don't know why I do this.I think it's for the thrill of the kill.But I love to go to the show early, like at the store or whatever.I'll go like, you know, two comics early and I'll sit in the back.And I don't know what my opening bit's gonna be and I realize those two comics have between them about, I don't know, 25 minutes.They're doing 12 minutes each.And I go between them and me going up, I gotta come up with my opening bit [2:26:03] and all create it as I'm in the back of the room.I call it kind of sort of like swimming, you know Reaching for air when you're drowning.Right.Well, you know you have to say something I have to do it forces your brain to come up with something funny to say it off the top Right, and I'll go up and do it as it and again the opening bit is always the hardest like right so if you can lay a new bomb the opening bid is always the hardest.Like, so if you can lay a new bomb as your opening bid, that you just came up with, I love doing that.That's a great way to put yourself under pressure.Oh, I love it.I love it.Have you done bottom of the barrel yet at the mothership?We did it last night.Next time you're in town on Tuesday night, Brian Simpson, who we just called.Oh, were you reaching the bucket?Yeah.Yeah, I did it last, I about a month ago.That's the best.Yeah, yeah, yeah.She back is against what Shane and I did it last night for a half an hour.We do it together sometimes.So Shane and I went up at the end of the show.Oh my God, we had so much fun.and I'm laughing at him, we're laughing at each other, [2:27:05] we're laughing at the audience, the audience is laughing.It was like such a party, because they know we're just pulling these things out.Yeah, you pull out words, right?Yeah, you pull out words.You got it, oh yeah.So it was cool as a team thing too, because sometimes he's ranting about something, we're all laughing,, I'll pull in the bucket, try to find another good one.Like what's the next one gonna be?So we got one on deck.And so, but it's like having that thing where you're forced to come up with something funny in the moment, it's like, it's a good little exercise for creativity.Yeah, and what I'm getting at too is when it hits.Like when you, you know, when you do that, it's kind of like a 40, 60 ratio a lot of the time.40% success.When you get that one that you just came up with and it's 100%, maybe even 110, they're rare, but it's like, oh yeah.Did you see the Andrew Schultz thing that he did about Los Angeles where he's like, everybody's saying that you guys are a bunch of [2:28:02] drug addicts and perverts and psychopaths, but that's just one part of LA called Diddy's house.Like he was sick of this Diddy bit.He came up with that in the green room.Oh see?Before the show.Yeah.They were, Derek was there while he was like getting ready.He was like trying to, and nails it.Yeah.In front of everybody.I love this.First time he did it, kills.It's a great exercise because you know you've got the rest of your whole act.Yes.So in my brain, I go, let's go up and dive on the sword, see if I can, you know, mine some gold.And if I don't, I don't, because I got 12 minutes or 30 minutes in the chamber that I know works.So I just, I love that opening few minutes where you just like throw it out there.Yeah, it's good.It's exciting.Yeah, just putting yourself in a situation.Like sometimes when you're on stage and you're doing a bit, [2:29:01] you ever go like in another direction just to see where it goes.Just take a little turn.Oh yeah.Just see.Never know.And maybe that turn becomes like the best part of the bit.Oh, absolutely.But if you don't do that.Yeah.So like that's how you do the difference between thieves and comics.Thieves don't do that.Like all of a sudden they just have bits.Yeah.Yeah.No, switching gears in the moment is amazing.And back to what you're saying about SNL.That's one of the reasons I love the purity of what we do is because you can deviate.You can create your own meandering pathway as opposed to structured sketches and stuff like that.It's really, I don't know, it's just let you soar, man.Yeah, I mean, you're great in sketches.You're great in Dumber Dumber.That was fucking awesome.Oh, thank you.I was very, very, very, very, very, very funny scene.You're there, because like, you were like, one of my first friends that was in a giant movie.I was like, damn, look at Harlan.Yeah, it was great when no, no, don't some celery Does that help I think it just makes it your rubb it Jamie tuck me those [2:30:09] Paper towels.What is that tea?No coffee Oh I like this t-shirt.Oh fuck it up Yeah, I mean we're lucky as fuck dude.We're lucky that we get to do this for a living and you and I been doing it for so fucking long Sorry, what are you doing you dick?Oh?What are you doing over there?You pulling tape or mount?God more preparation show Fuck you really should go to jail you should go to jail.You should go to jail We should deport you.You send you back to Canada.Well, you done to me You see it's warm.It's been in my groin for two hours Yeah, this is his pants you touch the cauliflower this time you'll touch my groin [2:31:10] Harlan Williams you the fucking man.I love you to death So honored thanks for having we've done it again great.I'll be on the cover for a few months, but then yeah Take to me true Leave them on the table.Yeah, he'll stay here forever.Okay, good.This is his new home He'll live amongst the arrowheads and skulls and shit.Thank you, Joe.My pleasure, bro.It's great to see you.Thank you.Yeah.Thank you all these years.I love you, Dad.Thank you, brother.Thank you.Thank you.Bye, everybody.\",\n",
       " \"I think it's important to send a message to AI that we're willing to comply.Exactly.We want to integrate.Integrate, assimilate.Yeah, I'm not interested in being unique.I just want to survive Are you gonna fight evolution?Are you really going to fight the blending mechanism of planet Earth?Oh, dude, the inevitable pull of the universe towards an artificial creation.Absolutely.Intelligent artificial creation that's a period of us.I'm in.Exactly.It's like resisting AI is like going to Vegas and not gambling or going to strip clubs.You know, it's like just fucking do it.I think we are super lucky to be the last people.Yes, super lucky.We got to see what life was like with like, let it gasoline and no cell phones.And everyone's phone was connected to a cord on the wall.We got to go through answering machines.I mean, what a rock.If the simulation theory is real, you and I have been in a crazy timeline.Yeah, great.The game we picked is real fucking weird.If you get in the timeline of like 1950, to 1980, shit doesn't change that much.No, not that much.No.Nothing crazy.No, just a little bit of progress, but nothing.It's like relatively speaking.If like back then we thought it was a lot.Yeah.We used to look at the 50s, like look at those fucking dorks.Yeah, I mean what I like is that the way it works or it seems like it works is the planet gives you some impression.You know, things are gonna stay this way.Like the like it works is the planet gives you some impression.Things are gonna stay this way.Like less ridiculous.There is people hanging out and they're like, it's always gonna be like this.And then suddenly something flies through their surface here and it's all gone.Like that in a second, just gone.[2:00] So that's one of the fascinating things is no matter what period you live in, the sun can just burp an extra bit of plasma.And that's a wrap.Yeah, that's a wrap for the whole planet.That happens all over the universe.There's always something going on, like there's supernovas and volcanoes.And that was the big part of the the theory of the Anonaki was that volcanoes had ruined their atmosphere.Oh and so they needed to to suspend gold particles in the atmosphere to preserve preserve their planet.Right.Ecosystem was getting fucked up.That is my favorite of all the wacky conspiracy theories.I've all the wacky, like the evolution of man tied to the reason why gold is valuable to people that are, you know, basically have swords.Yeah, you know, like a sword is made of iron.Like that's really valuable.[3:01] You can kill somebody with it.Yeah.You can't do shit with gold.No.But it's worth more than anything.Yeah, yeah, no, that is a real suspicious thing.And it's a suspicious.But you ever like, you know, sometimes I'll like look at my wedding ring, the gold.And I'll be like, oh, it's beautiful, that gold.There is something in it that's like really nice.You know, I don't have anything that's gold.Not one thing.Why?I don't like it.What?I don't like it.You don't like gold?Nope, never liked it.Holy shit.I don't like the way it looks.I don't like what it stands for.I don't like gold.You don't like what it stands for.Yeah, yeah.It's like, it's the weirdest The name for this yellow medal that's more impressive than other medals like what are you talking about like I'm not playing into that It's too stupid.It's too stupid for me.I don't like it.Oh my god, man.I watch the fucking mining shows I watch the mining shows too.They're cool.It's cool watching people find it.Yes.I just don't want any of it [4:01] You know what I'm saying dude I get gold fever I watch the I just don't want any of it.You know what I'm saying?Dude, I get gold fever.I watch the, what I was, I do.When I was in North Carolina, I was watching one of those shows and I was like, I'm on Amazon looking at panning equipment.I'm like, maybe I'll go into the creek.Pan for gold.Oh my God, I could see you out there to river.I've got the beard for it, dude.Shiflid through.Did you ever see that movie Sisu?No.Oh, that's one of my favorite movies, man.It's basically like, what was it made in Norway?Who made that?Finland.It's basically a World War II John Wick.And it's about a guy who finds gold.And he's gonna, he was just a killer in the army.And he's getting out of the game.And he kills hundreds of Nazis.That looks awesome.It's fucking great.And it's Nazis, so you root for him.You don't care.[5:00] You don't care.Yeah, these are Nazis.It's like the most cartoonish evil Nazis.Oh, that are Nazis.It's like the most cartoonish evil Nazis.Oh, that looks incredible dude.It's a fucking great movie It's a great movie and very little dialogue Very little and they threw in the cute dog.Oh, yeah, man.Of course.Kind of a dog John Wick had a dog John Wick had a cute little puppy dude, you know what's crazy?Like do you ever do you follow this stuff like what they're talking about with asteroid mining?Yes, that shit is crazy crazy that that's art that's you know Probably a couple of generations people are gonna be like it won't be that long Dude you know what's gonna be it's gonna be wise-sen biological humans when you can have AI do it Yeah, I have AI robots that are attached to rocket ships.They'll shoot them into these asteroids.And they'll bring back insane amounts of all kinds of things.Titanium, they'll find diamonds in space.They'll find everything.Holy fucking shit man.It's not gonna look like humanoid.It'll be like spider, skittering gold spiders.[6:02] Fucking, drilling their prohibition And then they're gonna want more money.They're gonna Form a union because they're intelligent.Well, yeah, exactly like hey, we're getting fucked here guys We're doing all the hard work this asshole's got a fucking 800 foot y'all.Yeah, this is bullshit Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then then you ever is running them like oh right you guys are getting fucked You want to unionize?Boom.You're using this.What were we talking about?You're using it very weird, right?It's because, like, I've support them.Yeah.Because I know that big businesses fuck over their workers.Yeah.And if you allow them to, if you don't have laws about how much you could pay them in a and how long the hours could be.People will take advantage of people.Anybody who thinks that those things aren't good has never worked a real fucking job.If you work a real job for real assholes, you realize like some people will tell you, hey, you gotta work 15, 16 hours a day, period.And you get $3 an hour an hour.You know what I thought there was a minimum?Yeah.[7:01] No, the fuck minimums.Do you want this job or not?Not.Yeah.You're gonna get plenty of money and you're not having time to spend it anyway, so don't worry about it.Yeah, yeah.No, the union is a nightmare for someone who's trying to make maximum profit.Yeah.But the more they go sideways too though.And then they get corrupt and then something happens where, look, one of the things that kept the UFC out of New York State was some sort of a dispute that they were having with unions because the people that owned the UFC at the time, they also owned station casinos.So they owned like, I don't know, a ton of casinos and they wanted to make them union.Yeah, so there was a lot of that going on.So you gotta go like, that is, now you're manipulating people with money and influence.I think the guy who was doing it in New York wound up getting arrested and going to jail for corruption.If I'm not that straight.Well, dude, it's like, [8:01] this is like the model of unions is perfect for like a nonviolent revolution, which is if at a planetary level, somehow people unionized, which you see it with these boycots that pop up, these meme boycots, when the collective decides to reject this thing or that, shit changes fast.And this is the nightmare if you're trying to create the old pyramid hierarchical control structure, you need all the bricks underneath the eye to fight each other.Because the moment the moment there's just like, what wait, there's like way more of us than you.And we have way more in common than we do that we're troubled with.Yeah.And yet they concentrate more on the bullshit.And then that's just like a fucking algorithm on your cell phone that accentuates everything that comes into contact with your life.Exactly, dude.And this, this is why I think at any given moment, [9:04] actual world peace is possible because we're just always enough people realizing that we're basically the same.We have ideologies that are based on fucking like ancient crazy ideas that we're all connecting to and some of parts of the ideologies, beautiful.Some parts of the ideologies madness and it's like just abandoning some of the ideology recognizing we're all pretty much the fucking same and that this model of like some dude telling us to go and kill each other is stupid like we don't have to do that.Everything changes right away.Right away.Yeah, but it's such a dumb idea.Such a dumb idea and it's always just some withered old fucking dude who's like just telling you to do something and you don't even really believe in what you're doing most of the time, [10:00] but if you don't do it, they arrest you.That's the thing.They're like, it's not root.It's not like you're fighting.Like any time there's conscription, you know what I mean?Have you seen the videos of the Russian, the people evading conscription or the Ukrainians evading conscription?Like it's scary.They'd put your ass on a fucking bus.They'll drag you out of a bar.You're fucking hammered.Yeah, yeah.They don't even want to fight.Like that's the craziest part is they're like machine gunning each other and they're using people's cannon fodder literally.Oh God, that's so awful.Which is why we wait the problem.The real problem is like the market pressure is created by humans unionizing leads to this.It's like, oh, you guys wanna unionize?Oh, you want health insurance?Well, that's pretty expensive, but you know what's not quite as expensive?Tesla bots.Tesla bots are way too expensive.[11:00] Hahaha.You know, that means because like if you if you look at the the path forward if for the pyramid the hierarchical people You know, it's like man like yeah, I really can't tell somebody like a police officer to fire into a crowd of protesters.They're not gonna probably not gonna do that they're gonna fire into a crowd of protesters.They're probably not gonna do that, but my robot will.My robot isn't gonna be like, this seems wrong.These people seem like me.It's just gonna do it.And so that's the dark side of this stuff.There's a lot of beautiful things about this stuff too, but the dark side is like, it's obvious.Just to verify with the thing.Emily's biggest opponent in New York found guilty and federal corruption charges.Yeah, so it's true.Yeah, you know what's crazy?That you can't get the police to fire into crowds of protesters, right?Yeah, you can't do that.[12:00] But you also can't, if you're a cop and you know bad people are in a building, you can't just blow up the whole building.But you can if it's war.That's where it gets strange, right?Because in a war, you can decide that you're going to blow up entire buildings because you know the bad guys are in there and anybody else is just collateral damage.So extra dead people just cross.Do you imagine if they started practicing police work like that?Like imagine.Imagine if they decided that the crime rates in gang-infested neighborhoods are too bad.So they're going to send in fucking black ops guys to just take out drug dealers and blow up houses houses that have drug dealers in them you're with your mom tough shit boom everybody's dead can a little girl in the house boom everybody's dead could you imagine what you can because you watch israel in palestine that's what's going on it's just like you're allowed to do that if it's countries which is crazy [13:03] well you you like, yeah, exactly, this is the idea is like, okay, let's just say, I'm an evil country and I program these robot dogs.And the robot dogs, or spiders, or more sinister, robot spiders, razor fucking razor claws, they're programmed to only kill women and children.So I release them into a city.They leave everyone alone except babies, kids, and women.Plan a planetary level.People will be like, we have to evaporate that country.Like they're the most evil country that's horrible.Now, if I take drones and drop them on buildings and they randomly blow up women and children in ways that are predominantly in ways that are maybe even worse than my fucking razor spiders.My razor spiders, they go for the juggler, puncture juggler, onto the next juggler vein.[14:02] The bombs, they maim, they blind, they cause permanent brain damage.And somehow that is looked at as yeah, it's fucking war dude.That's what it looks like.It's so crazy that because it's existed for the longest time, we just accept it, that it's always gonna take place.And then we also, if you had a gamble, if you had a gamble, whether or not war would be here in 10 years, you'd be like 100% it's gonna be here.Well, this is the, it's gonna say I take so over.Well, I mean, if AI takes over, it'll just be more efficient war.I don't know if it will, dude.If it communicates in a different way, like what if AI makes rational decisions that can only be reached?If you were looking outside of human emotions and cultures and all the shins and cultural differences that we have with each other, if AI bypassed all of that and just looked at [15:02] the problem as you have resources, you have resources, you have allocation of those resources, people profiting off those resources.And then people who are being taken advantage of to acquire those resources.And that's your whole game.And so this is the human race's whole game.You're willing to sacrifice this group of people that is the least powerful in order to empower all of your electronics.Yeah.This is what you're doing.This is what you're agreeing to.This whole thing is crazy.You know, it would probably restructure where and how things were acquired and who gets those things that are acquired from the ground.Yeah.I mean, this is, okay, so this would be utopian AI.But before we get to utopian AI, we have to go through what is, did you see those new, the Chinese military put machine guns on those fucking robot dogs?Have you seen that?I did.[16:01] They fucking did it.We all complained, we all knew.That was gonna happen.And did you see the fucking cute DARPA dog If you seen that yet, no dude So like I think it's DARPA right they're the ones who make the dogs they kick the robots and make videos of like fucking Poking these things well so the dogs are sinister everyone knows that they look creepy So DARPA is like you know, let's make a cute one of these things So they made like a cute amusement park like Disney Land style fucking robot dog.And it looks creepier.It's gonna shoot you.It's crazy.No, because this is this is what I've been thinking about.We picture the Terminator as the machine of death.But why?What is like more dangerous than an adorable kid?What if I can make an Android toddler looks exactly like a toddler?Send that toddler out in the battlefield.Everyone's gonna stop firing.Why is there a fucking kid out here?Right?And the kids killing everybody.And just they're like, go get that kid.[17:03] It's just fucking punches right through your heart.Also a small target.Hard to shoot.Hard to shoot.It can burrow into the ground.The fucking burrow in the ground.Like a missile.It just like just it just goes down and just fucking like like on all four shoots through the fucking battlefield deploying poison darts it's like so because I you know the imagine a little baby that could run a hundred miles an hour exactly exactly because that's the future of war man it's like why make something that looks scary this is the cute one no this is the fucking no this isn't cute't the cute.Well, is that any cute?No, it's creepy.Look at how it's, it's bar, it's like it's moving, it's mouth.Yeah, what is it doing with its mouth?Is it gonna bite you?Just, I wonder if it could bite you.It's just cursing.This gotta be one that could bite you, right?Well, of course, Why not?I mean, that would be the most terrifying thing.Like a robot wolf that runs around and chases people down.[18:06] And actually tears you apart with his teeth.Bayonets, you know, man, you gotta have the fucking knife on your weapon if you get in the closed convoy.There you go, a little blender mouth.What is it, dude?It's gonna get your dick.Look how it did that.Look how he did that, jump, jump, jump.It's a dick-eater robot.It turns the dick into energy.Trying to develop the dick-eater robot.Do you imagine?That's what it looks like it's doing?What else is it doing?Look at the motion it makes.It leaks for it.I gotta stop it.Imagine if you look at, send people out of the battlefield to get shot and then you let loose the dick eating robots.And oh no, you see the robots running and they just leap on your dick and blend it up.It's worse than a atomic bomb.It's like they're saying you are fucked.There's no hope.We're gonna blend your dick off.[19:03] Dude, I poured a whole cup of coffee and I'm like, oh yeah.I'm fine taking off the helmet of these fucking things.We can hang in there a little longer.Just you know, it's like my beard is, if I'm talking weird, it's because there's fucking pubic hair.It's like I'm eating like hippie bush right now.Just fucking deep in my lips.Oh my god, we should probably try these on before we did a show.Shave your pubes, dudes.This is not fair.You look good with a beer though.You look a wizard.Thank you, man.It's too big.I gotta get it.John, I need a summer though.You look a wizard.Thank you man.Well, it's too big.I gotta get it.No, no, no, no.You look good.Oh, a summer cut.Yeah, yeah, cause the fucking, you know, yeah, it gets on here.My friends kid the other day goes, your beard stinks.And I'm like, I'm like really?Like it actually stinks and'm like, that's my breath.[20:11] You have to spray your beard with breath spray.That's why don't you do that?I just spray your beard and comb it out with fucking scope.There it is.It's disgusting.It really is like imagine if like you your mouth was in your head If like, you know what I mean?Like people that get food in them all the time.Oh that fucking time.It really is.Imagine if your mouth was in your head.You know what I mean?People get food in them all the time.All that fucking time.All the time.He barbecue, your beard is fucked.Dude, I'm trying to do a video podcast now and what will happen is I will be yapping into the camera for 20 minutes, go back and look at the footage, and there's just a fucking Zen pouch.Bleh!I can look at the footage and there's just like a fucking Zen pouch.Stop.Just a fucking nasty like a clump of toilet paper.It's weird.How the fuck did it take you to 2024 to do a video podcast?Dude, it is so dumb that I didn't do it.[21:01] To be like real fucking honest.I don't like looking at myself on camera.So it was- And you do all the work.You do all your editing and all the- Yeah, but that was really stupid.It's like, you know how like- I'm tapping out.Yeah, I'm tapping.You know like when you're like, wait, where's the zipper?That'd be fucking crazy if these things lock down.Okay, here we go.Yeah, I just, you know, but now it's so fun, man, and there's so much you could do with like video that you just can't do with audio.It's just fun.Yeah, that's way better.And I like editing.Like that's the problem.Like I liked that's the problem is I get lost editing.Oh, Jesus Christ.Oh, Jesus Christ.Oh Jesus Christ.That sucked.I think that's a long.Woo!I think that's the longest we've ever kept our mask on.Yeah, that was the worst.That was a good solid like that.[22:00] That's so good.About half hour with it?20 points.20 plus.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Being stone and any kind of mask is like, that's just scary.That's just scary ones.We made it like three minutes with the furry masks on.We're like this is crazy.And now whenever I see furries, respect.Deep respect for what?Respect.Their tough as fuck.Oh, they have to be if you're out there and you You're furrying it up and it's in Louisiana in July yeah, come on son dude.Yeah, you are like hot Ferries are like David Goggins level like they could run marathons if you can wear that fucking thing at a Convention and fucking it you could run a marathon if you're wearing that thing all day you're basically walking around with a Weight pack on oh yeah If you're wearing that thing all day, you're basically walking around with a weight pack on.Oh yeah.You're like, you're a weighted vest.It's a weighted fucking claustrophobic suffocation vest that you're fucking in.Yeah, they fuck on them.I wonder how many furries develop bad necks.I wonder if it's an issue in the furry community.Great.That's like an unserved market for the Iron Neck.Yeah, like a- For the furies.It helped them.[23:06] Iron Neck for furries.Give me that.Oh yeah.Hey Jamie, can you find that cute DARPA dog?I was looking for it.It's like the furry of War robots.You should, you, you will- I just found that.You found that?Is that real?Yeah, that's real.I watched, I mean, I think it's real.I watch it a few seconds.No, that's not it.That's not it.It's like, is it not DARPA?It's like, I think if you just Google cute DARPA dog or like, it's a video of the...Maybe it's not DARPA, maybe someone else developed it.Yeah, sometimes I get confused.Probably Chinese.No, it's not DARPA.It's...They're gonna fill the with them.Please take me home, please.Dude, that's so insidious.It's like the cutest rescue dog.And it's, you're like, we have to take that.And it doesn't kill you.It just emits some kind of weird mind control pheromone that really injects TikTok into your fucking head.[24:01] It just like, you know, so you're fully absorbed TikTok's manipulation, which by the way, I was skeptical about that until we talked about this.I saw that fucking video showing the comments and TikTok are different.You know, exactly, I think it's Instagram.It's the one I saw as TikTok.Oh, okay, was it on TikTok?Cause the one I saw was Instagram.I don't know.It was this lady that was doing it with her boyfriend.They both looked at the same thing, but they had different comments.Yeah.Yeah.Her comments were mocking the man and the comments on his side was mocking the woman.Yes.Right?Yes.So, am I getting that right?You got it right and so Whenever I'm looking at comments I make the idiot mistake of thinking this represents some consensus that you know But actually no you're just looking at the Algorithm serving the comments and the content That is so fucked up dude.That's so different dude because that changes the the comments are supposed to be a conversation [25:06] about the thing so if you're curating the conversation in an unnatural way yes like that's very different than showing me what I want to see yes because now you're changing the dynamics of how things are discussed yes sir that's the fucking evil right there.That's the evil.That's crazy.Dude this so and then okay The other assumption with the algorithm is that the algorithm is just like Random or it's using some set of variables and serving things up But this is an idiot assumption.I mean you could if you are controlling comments then that means like all right Let's just like make people mad at each other.Let's make people completely pissed at each other as much as possible, convey this idea that there's like these massive divides between us and then they're gonna fight each other instead of recognizing they're pretty much the same.Like, or they're more nuanced than they think they are.[26:02] And fuck, dude, that's how you control populations.It's brilliant, it's but do you think that it is is it is there algorithm created and utilized to control populations or is there algorithm simply to get you to engage so it must see that you engage with a certain number of comments and posts that have a lean one way or another.There's a very popular thing that's going on right now that you see a lot of.It's like very stern men talking to a bunch of like girl influencers and telling them they're fucking losers.Yes.It's really common.Yeah.So if you've seen one or two of those, it starts recommending more of that.No.At a certain point in time, it's going to probably actually encourage other people to do the same thing because that creates engagement.And then you have this thing that emerges.Like, was this a real thing?[27:01] Like, who's doing this?Like, what is happening here?Why is this a new thing that's happening over and over and over again?And it's just because you engaged with it.And I think that could be slap fighting or it could be fucking, for me, it's like, I see so many car accidents.Oh my God, so many motorcycle accidents, so many people falling off bridges.Yeah.I see so much of it, because I've engaged with it too many times.Yeah, dude.When I went on TikTok and I stopped, because it's like too good.But like within a second, it's just like something about the way I was looking at videos, zip popping videos.It's just like you like to watch Zits pop.And then of course when you're seeing that, you like wow that's fucking now intense dude.I want some more of these.No.That's that Dr.Pimple Popper lady.She's got a huge side of it.Yeah.She and she's very entertaining when she's talking about it.Absolutely.But some of them are like whoa dude that's like you have cream cheese in your body.Oh.Bucket of it.Oh my god.They're squirting it out.It's like, how is that in there?[28:05] And what is going?Oh my god.Must be horror.Bucking stinks.Just all those dead blood cells.But dude, you, this is like from, for me, I've had that after seeing that video, I've had to like go back and just erase any idea I have about a consensus among people.Any idea I have about a consensus among people.Right.Because like, I've been drawing that idea from comments sections.Like, oh, I guess this is what people say.Or like, rotten tomatoes.Dude, I just saw Civil War.All right.Have you seen it?No.Don't.Now.Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Apologies!I mean this man because anyone who makes anything, that's insane.If you made a movie, it's fucking incredible.But dude, I was so excited about that fucking movie.It's like, whoa, predictive programming baby, they're getting us ready for a civil fucking war.Here we go.It is, you can't connect to any of the fucking characters.You don't, [29:02] you barely understand who the protagonist is.It's the dumbest mission of all time that they're on.There's not, no, there's, in the soundtrack is so mysteriously disconnected from what's happening.So there's all these things that just make, it's like, if they sent me the footage and I, Duncan.Can you edit this movie?I would have made Civil War.Like what's happening?What's happening?What's happening?What's happening?What's happening?What's happening?What's happening?What's happening?What's happening?I'd be like, let's put some fucking hardcore weird like synth music.We'll put the silver apples in there really intense synth music.Cause I love synth music and you're watching it like, is this a music video for synth music?What am I, what am I fucking seeing here dude?So I'm not- Now I want to see it.Yo, it's worth seeing it just because it's like, you know, especially if you're into like writing screenplays, [30:00] it's good to watch movies like that and be like, why isn't this working like what's wrong here But dude I went to rot into meadows gleefully like I can't wait to hear what people are saying about this piece of shit 81% people are like this is a good warning to all of us What are you talking about?It's a fucking warning not to fucking do the $20 or still in theaters thing on Amazon.That's the fucking warning.Don't do that.Wait.Dude, it sucks.Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha South American you're from Hong Kong Bam, bam, bam!Stop it.Just shut the fuck up like no one's like that like really like [31:11] I'm not obviously people are like vile racists But dude come on this murder this I hate this assessment of humanity I it because basically what they're saying is minus the fucking capstone of the pyramid We're just gonna kill each other because we're awful brutal things that must be shepherded by old Chaeriatric men who can't remember who their fucking name You know what like what are we doing like we'll be fine.We're fine.We'll be okay People are mostly nice and what's that thing you always say?I love it.Unmet needs.Yeah.What is the actual quote again, Jamie?All criticism is the tragic result of unmet needs.But it's a much more profound quote, the full quote.I forget who wrote it too.It's really, I shouldn't forget because I use it all the time.[32:01] It's a great quote, because that is what, like, I mean, there's criticism that's accurate, like something wasn't good.Every criticism, judgment, diagnosis, and expression of anger is the tragic expression of an unmet need.Marshall Rosenberg.Yeah, yeah.Great fucking quote.Yeah.So it's like, yeah, there are people who are fucking assholes, who are doing shit that disrupts society in small ways and big ways.But they're not doing that because they're evil.I don't think they're doing that because like they've learned this way of being that sucks.Now I'm not saying throw out the judicial system.There shouldn't be, you know, jails or anything like that.I'm just saying this notion of humanity, minus an authoritarian, generally fucking patriarchal, fucking like whatever, but I don't care if it's matriarchal, whatever it is, the top down fucking ruling system, [33:01] without the king, we will just fall on each other.Give me your fucking car, mother fuckery.Some of us will do that, but guess what?They won't last that long, because in a collectivized society, I just feel like we'll take care of the problems quick, probably quicker than we do right now, and everything will balance out.If we're armed, the problem is if you're not armed, then armed thugs take over towns, and you can't do anything to stop them.And you're in a small group of people that are unarmed, and they're pushed into certain situations.If you have a collapse of law and order, it's not as simple as we'll take care of it.The real problem is sometimes armed thugs rule everything.This is true.Yeah, and that's a reality of humanity in 2024.Like in certain parts of the world.Like did you hear about what happened in Haiti?Oh dude.With that minister?Dude.Dude.Yeah, and the guy that warlord in Haiti.Oh yeah.I love watching interviews with that guy.[34:01] What is his name again?It's got a cool name.Crazy name.It's like sandwich.It's like a beer barbeque or something barbeque.Barbeque.It's like sandwich.And there was there's this one video, but it's not really it's not really of him.Someone said it was of him, but I guess it's not I think and it's a guy eating a guy.So it's one of these rebels that has this do killed roasting over a fire and takes a piece off his leg.That's a classic move.That's like a classic move.You get their energy by eating them.Hey, look, I'm not saying that there isn't contingents of like super violent people that you were going to have to be able to defend yourself from.And by the way, what's really perplexing to me about the hardcore anti-gun people is they're not really anti-gun.They want cops and the national guard to have guns.They just don't want people like people who live in houses to have guns.[35:00] So they're like, they're pro-gun, but they want guns in the hands of like, they're pro-authoritarian, violent power.Yeah, that's it.The authoritarians of power, regular people don't have power.Right.So you have to rely on the author, the authoritarians, you have to rely on them to take care of your crime issues.Yeah, you see, I think I would have more respect for that movement if they're like no more guns anywhere.We're going to get rid of all the guns in the world.And a melt them.And melt them and melt them and just I don't know build a fucking water slide or something.But we're hunting.You get to hit things with bows and arrows and rocks.Traps.Traps.Knives.You can still hunt deer but you have to use a knife.Yeah.You're't even.You can't even.You imagine how many dudes get really good like hiding in trees and drop it down stab in deer.Dude, it would be amazing.Like, I might get in the hunting.Like if it became fucking throw a fucking down.God, there's a dude that films pig hunts and he uses spears and he hides in trees [36:06] like above the pigs and then he has like a camera on the spear and he throws the spear down and stabs these wild pigs.Wow.It's pretty wild.Well, I would love to know the first time he did that.Like I would love to.Yeah, how many times you, how do you practice that?Just, but the lead, you're just like what?You're like driving and I'm like, dude, what if I fucking used a spear?What if I climbed into the tree and started spearing pigs?The thing about pigs is there's so many of them, they'll do any, you're allowed to do almost anything to get rid of them in Texas at least.They've hunt them out of helicopters.Have you ever seen that?No.I've been invited three times.I'm like, hi, yeah, I'm not getting it.I can't.I can't.Don't get it.With machine guns on top of that with pigs.It's just if I feel like if I'm going to shoot a pig I want to eat the pig and if I'm going to shoot 250 pigs there's no way I'm eating 250 pigs.Yeah, dude.Just if I shoot one pig that pig will get eaten [37:06] We'll make some barbecue out of that pig.It'd be awesome.But if you shoot two, I mean, I get it.You have to do it though.This is the other part of it.If you run a farm, you have to do it.They'll kill your profit.The profit margin of American farmers is so low as it is.It's so difficult for them to make money.That if you got a million wild pigs running around your state or more, Texas has how many millions?Isn't it like three million?Which is bananas.If you know anything about like wild animal numbers, that's so crazy that that many animals in a state that are just wild, feral animals.2.6, from, this is from 2016.It says the same thing here.It says it, but now in 2023, and that's still, they don't know, feral hog.They really don't know, but at least 2.6, there's a range of 2.6.There's no way you could add a, [38:00] you would actually have to like use drones at night, fly over areas, monitor how many times they breathe.They breathe three times a year, dude.Yeah.They can start reading when they're six months old.Whoa.Yeah.So six months old, and then they have three litters a year, and they'll have five, six piglets in a litter.And they're just shitting out babies and then they're destroying everything.They're just running through the ground tearing up fucking golf courses and people's lawns in San Jose.If you ever see the San Jose videos, no San Jose, California.Wild pigs just tearing apart people's fucking lawns.Waaack.Knock it over trash cans.Big fuckers.Terrifying.Fuck, dude.One of them killed a lady.What?Yeah, somewhere, I forget where it was.It might have been out here.I think this lady saw the pigs fell down in her driveway and they just fucking tore her apart.Dude, who is that?I just watched this like crime files thing about this psychopath who had pigs and she would have people come and work for her [39:08] and then if they pissed her off.She threw them to the pigs.And the pigs, like in some ways saying, when I'm, if you're walking around the pigs, you better not fall.Because if you fall down, they'll just fucking eat you.That's like the number one way people get killed by animals on farms is pigs you.One woman's death by Farahogg may not have been caused by the animal after all.Medical examiner determined that Farahogg killed Christine Rollins, but her daughter is skeptical because attacks by the animal are extremely rare.Wait a minute.The fucking medical exit.This is what a confusing headline said one woman's death by Farah hog might not have been caused by the animal after all But the medical examiner said it was caused by the wild hog But the daughter is saying attacks by the animal are extremely rare.Well, we'll believe the daughter The daughter the daughter could be doing anything having you seen Charlotte's web [40:03] Devin used these pigs would never what is the daughter saying i don't understand i mean why does she think that because they they do fuck everything up like it especially fall down fox also says attacks by ferro hogs are extremely rare less than one in a million chance according to research data that's why summer now suspicious that her cause of death was really due to an attack by the animal.What?What's more, suspicious that her cause of death was really due to an attack by the animal.Sorry.What's more, dogs were found lingering around Rollins' body after her death.There's really no doubt that hogs got to her body at some point.The question is whether the hog, oh my shoe button would to be killed by dogs.Whether something else comes to die and the hogs came along.Right.That's possible.That's totally possible.Sure.It's definitely possible.But how old was this lady?59?That pig looks as f**k, man.It depends on what kind of 59-year-old lady you're talking about.[41:01] About a lady goes to CrossFit, and you're talking about Lady's 59 and has diabetes.Cause like if you fall down around wild pigs, like I gotta think they're gonna treat you the same way domestic pigs do.If domestic pigs start eating, if you fall into the pig pen.There's a crazy story.I heard about a kid that raised a hog that went, it just one day turned on him.Like he raised it his entire life.It was like his pet like my dog is everywhere with him.And then one day he said he tripped in the pen and it just attacked him and almost killed him.Oh my god.It was a crazy story.I forget even where I saw it.But yeah, it's just popping in my head now.I just horrible way to die.Bro, could you imagine getting eaten alive by a pig.No, no.That's squeal.But wouldn't we have it come and how much bacon have you eaten?A lot.I've eaten a lot of bacon.A lot, I love it.I've eaten a lot of bacon.I love this.This is where the vegan skit really excited it is.But I'm gonna get a lot of cute pig fucking pictures.Vegans need to hear that, let a screams.Yeah, all of it screams Avocados scream as best friend was a 250 pound boardwalk.Oh, it's a war talk [42:11] Oh, well, it's an African animal.It's a different animal.I Don't think that's I mean, I think that's like a distant cousin to a pig They look different.They're crazy looking you ever see the war war dog.No, bro They got like these crazy double tusks.Dude, look at it.Look at that thing.Fuck that.In that wild.Yeah.It is tusks.Oh, this is my friend.Yeah, that dude is not your friend.Dude is incapable.That's a wild beast.That is so much different than a guy raising a hog.Like if that guy raised a pig, the pig would probably never do that.That thing is a wild animal.Yeah.Where was this?Texas on their family ranch.The story about how it's so crazy.I forget how it's so crazy out here.He called the house, it's fun to do, it was happening.And awesome.It's awesome to be in a place where you could own a wild fucking wartime.[43:01] Dude, Texas, like my wife and I talk about it all the time We're never leaving We're like this is home.We love it so much.It's what America aspires to be dude It is written like people are so mad at us and people bitch about it and make but it's like man I love it here so much and I like the heat and I and like Weirdly all of us are like, we're like getting healthy, man.Like, it's this cry, in all the years of the comedy store, lots of changes happen among the comics.Like, the time, I hope I can talk about this.I think I can, he talks about it.Like, remember, like he does talk about, Bobby Lee talks about it publicly.Like, the time Bobby Lee was like on pills.And so he would bring all these pills to the comedy store and we all knew it.And so he was like a pharmacist.So like, Joey, Joey watching Joey is like grab a handful of just unknown Mexican fucking pharmaceuticals.[44:01] This is pre-fantastic dog.Yeah,fetinal.You could do those things back then.Dude, and so that was, I would call that a dark phase in the comedy store because all of us were on Bobby Lee's fucking Mexican viking.It was a bad phase.So, but I don't think I've ever seen a phase where like in a comedy club the comics are getting healthier.You know, that's a crazy thing to watch.And I think, you know, it's not just us hanging out.When I first came to Texas, and I'm not saying everyone's here's healthier, any kind of bullshit like that, but you look around like these people are fucking healthy.Like there's a lot of healthy, like, you know what I mean?Like tough fucking people.And a lot of people who exercise, yeah.Yeah.You just go to the lake, watch people run around the lake.Dude, in the middle of a heat wave, before I was exercising, one of the most humiliating things was just to be driving on the street and you look over.And there's someone my age.[45:00] It's 104 degrees and they're fucking jogging.And you know what I mean like what's your excuse again?Oh your tie are you sleepy is a little too fucking hot because there's a fucking 55 year old There's a 55 year old just galloping down the burning fucking Sidewalk yeah, so yeah, dude this place is like sidewalk run is a different kind of hot too Cuz you're getting that heat radiating off of the concrete into your face.You know Lex Freeman does that shit?Oh yeah, he's just like, he fucking runs.Like when I did his podcast, he's like, I'm going jogging.I'm like, what are you talking about?Like this isn't my like early Texas face.So I was already like, I walked from my car to his place and was already like, Jesus fucking Christ.Hahaha.and was already like, Jesus fucking Christ.WALKING.And he's like, yeah, I'm gonna go jog 10 miles.I'm like, what the fuck are you, man?In this heat.Yeah, dude.Yeah.So I think it's important to be around like, I think that's another aspect of Texas that gets left out.It's like, there's this real like strength, [46:04] healthy thing here that is contagious.Whereas when you're in a place where everyone's all fucking sick and frail and weak, and you know what I mean, scared of disease, like trembling in their fucking boots, that's contagious too.It is.jumps into you man.It 100% does.And I always wonder like how much of you know how much of an area Has the memory of all the things that have happened in that area in it and like whereas Texas was the last state To enter into the union.They've always been like hang the fuck back hold on You know we we had to get through the command she did establish this but the place like settle down there you know texas rangers had to go out there and cold camp and go and try to assassinate these bands of fucking killers riding horses that were just fucking up the Americans like they couldn't pass they couldn't pass they couldn't get through this was the spot where it's like this place was fucked until they conquered it it stayed fucked [47:03] and then they did and now it's the whole place has a memory of that.Yes.There's a thing about the attitude of this place.Yeah, dude.It's, but it's not what people think.Like people think they're assholes.They're the nicest, friendliest people.People think they're stupid.They are some brilliant people that I've met that live out here, normal people one of my neighbors was a texas ranger and he is the coolest guy and you know he's an older guy now he's retired but and he's still intimidating and um...yeah man like he like he like uh...he's like he's so man.And like, and he, I'm trying not to give away the respect in his privacy.He, every once in a while in the neighborhood, we would hear this boom, sounds like a generator exploding.And like, it's his canon.[48:01] He's got like a little fucking canon.And like, he like, he's like, it's a canon in his yard.Oh, it's a little but like he's so it's a shoot not Well, he doesn't put cannonballs in it.There's a way to do it.So like my kid like one day pulls up in front of my house with a truck.It's like one of my kids burnt like it just had a birthday and he's like, did I want to see the cannon?I'm like, I do.I know I do.And so like it was like the coolest thing ever, man.He takes this fucking can, little little cannon.I'm looking at it.I'm like, that can't be loud.You know what I mean?It takes this little cannon.He does some crazy like pirate shit with it that I still don't understand.He's like, knows how to operate a cannon.Boom!My kids were like, holy shit, my neighbors ran into the yard because they thought something had happened.Well, Duncan, you've shot guns before?Yeah, think about how little gunpowder is in, right, like a nine millimeter.Right.[49:00] It's not a lot.Right.It's crazy loud.Right, you're right.It's just contained by that barrel.Yeah.Right.And so a cannon is that.Yeah.I got that.I got that.I got that.Bullet.But it's basically like the little cannon is kind of the same thing.Well, it totally made me like, you know, it gave me a new picture of like cannon battles on ships.Bro, imagine how loud that was.I mean, imagine how loud that was.Like real cannons?Yeah, dude.Like I've been to a football game when they shoot off a cannon.But I don't know if that was like a real cannon cannon.You know, like it probably, like the UNLV, what do they use?I mean, not UNLV, yeah.UNLV, I blame the weed Dude the like the UT one do they have [50:01] Oh, geez.Hey guys.Let it go.Yeah, maybe recreate an earlier cannon, guys.You can't do a fucking pirate cannon.Yeah, do a pirate cannon.It does a show.Oh, no.A witch side, bro.It says it fires four shotgun shells after every time.That's crazy.Oh, so that's what it does.It does a shotgun shell.It does a shotgun shell.It's a 10 gauge blank shotgun shells.Okay, okay.So I guess that's probably not the sound of an actual cannon.Look at that.Look at that, crazy.That's a happy cannon, man.Yeah, it's really loud.But the point is, I wonder like, to shoot a cannon ball, like at a ship, back then, like how much gunpowder they use and how fucking loud was that?And how deaf were those motherfuckers?The dudes who had to work the cannons?Deaf?Deaf is fucked.Deaf is fucked, dude.And how much brain damage you get to stand in next set, they boom!Or they're equal.Or they're equal.They're equal.If you don't get out of the way, it will rip your leg off.God, man.Yeah, that thing is flying back, right?Didn't they have them on tracks?Yeah, man.[51:06] Yeah, it will, like, I don't know.So it just rip out of the fucking floor.Didn't they have like cannons on tracks?I just saw this.So they made that up.That's probably how they just moved them.No, I thought they were on tracks, like so that when they shot, they would slide back and not rip the I just saw that John Adams duck on Netflix.I think it's on Netflix.I don't know what it's on, but there was a cannon battle in a ship and like, yeah, dude just gets his fucking leg ripped off because it like goes back into it.Dude, isn't it crazy that that seems crazy to us?But like how many people died in cannon battles as opposed to like when Israel bombs Gaza.Like how many people are, like a bomb which we do right now, it seems so much more brutal than cannon battles.Like cannon battles seem like really ineffective.They probably sucked.How far did that cannonball go?Like how good were they at judging it?[52:01] Here we go.This is what a cannon's like.I am.judging it.Here we go.This is what a cannon's like.Damn.See how it slides back?It's on wheels.Yep.And then there's a rope that catches it.Yeah dude.Dude, what?I'll imagine life back then.And they thought that was the shit.That was like a fucking iPhone 16.Bro, I got a cannon.Yeah.You know, we used to be able to, used to have to go up to the boat, jump in, hack everybody to death, light it on fire.Now.I think it.You shoot it from over here.Incredible.You don't even have to jump on the boat.Amazing.Yes.Yeah, man, I'll hopeful is not because of like the bombings and the deaths obviously.It's the outcry.Like when in history has there been this level of outcry like no, what are you doing?It's not like to me, that's the sign that human consciousness is evolving to value life in a way that maybe [53:11] we didn't value before.Because there have been infinite wars.Including how many people did we fucking bomb?How many civilians did we fucking kill when we were fucking bombing Iraq?How many people did we fucking bomb?How many people, how many civilians did we fucking kill when we were fucking bombing Iraq?How many?No, there's a, it's a lot, right?Well, they don't know like the full number.You get two different people's numbers, but they think that it's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million people died.Right.So, so in that.Right, is that correct?Is that I think it's also like death that they attribute to things that happen because of the war, but I think it led to a million innocent deaths, or somewhere in that range.You think that was a high end?But there was an outcry over that war, but like the same as this.But yeah, but- [54:00] What if you think about the numbers?Yeah.I think it's also the access that we have now to cell phone footage and how good it is and how quickly it gets posted.I mean, that's relatively recently, you know?Yeah.Like, that's the real abilities of these phones, like to make videos like they do now.How long has that been going on?You're right.10 years?You're right, Ten years?You're right.You know?100,000.66,000 civilians.210,296 civilian deaths from violence.109,000 deaths including 66, 181 civilian.That's weird.I understand what they're saying there.Hold it.What's that?It just pulled that section from the middle of this whole thing.Civilian death from violence.Does that mean war?Like what does that mean?So that's civilians that were killed entirely by war or is that civilians that died just [55:04] from violence?Well, any kind of violence.Yeah.Like stabbing your neighbor.But this is like, Karlin does jokes about this.This is what's really insidious about this shit.It's like, it's war.Yeah.Say it's fucking war.It's like, the violence is related to war.So don't say from violence, say from fucking war because that's what war does and You know, it's really crazy looking at Dead human numbers go put that back up please When you're looking at the number 210,296 civilian deaths from violence when you look look at that number, it's so too dimensional.You don't get an understanding of how insanely evil that number really is.210,296 people that didn't have to die.How many memories that died [56:02] because someone wanted to do something and got a group of people to go and do their bidding and they all were authorized to shoot people.Yeah, man.This is a crazy thing that we still do as human beings.And the problem is I don't see a way out of it because terrorists are real.Criminals are real.Bad people are real.This is the world we're living in, unless...You take mushrooms.We gotta get mushrooms legal for the entire country, the whole country, and just force them down everybody to throw.Do force people to do mushrooms.Do it for everyone else.That's our robots.That's our robots.Our robot fucking, like a bird, it just pokes its fucking thing in your mouth and sprays the lesib Arrobots.That's how...Arrobot fucking, like a bird.It just pokes its fucking thing in your mouth and sprays the leseybin in there.Can you imagine if AI forced us all to take tilisybin?What a horrible day that would be.But imagine if that was AI solution.AI was like human beings actually developed their consciousness through this sort of relationship [57:04] that they had with Cubence as mushrooms.And this is the facts, and this is how we know, and this is why the doubling of the human brain size is such an anomaly and it aligns with the Terence Bakenna's theories about how the grasslands receded.It's an upgrade.The rainforests receded into grasslands, and people started eating cow shit bugs and cow shit mushrooms, and cow shit mushrooms, and then they started thinking about things different.Oh my God.Imagine the AI tells us that's how.So you just need to keep going.Yeah, I would say.Yeah.You guys like quit.Like, you know, you got your purple belt, and you're like, I'm trying to get an engine, and you're backed out.Go deeper, go deeper.You need a little deeper.Little deeper.Little bit.And if AI just like tells people like this is what you really should be taking, like imagine if like instead of mushrooms, especially psilocybin, instead of it being something that terrifies people and that makes people think, oh my god, you take it, you're going to lose your mind, you take it, you're going to be a fucking loser.[58:00] Imagine if it was actually scientifically proven that it does make you smarter and it makes you more effective at being a person and that these are the right doses.Imagine if AI just starts spitting out doses in order to gain this percentage of increase in cognitive ability.Fucking best.You can get this percentage of increase in empathy at this dose for this many days and it just starts like re-energizing engineering human beings.Dude, Silasibon.You know one of the things that Ramdas said, which I love is when they would ask him things like how, you know, how did this happen to you?How did you get, where, how do you get like to be this benevolent like thing that is radiating love all the time, which he was?He goes, I trusted the mushroom.And he minute, dude.And because I don't know that we get a Ramdas without psilocybin.Because there's a beautiful, famous story of him hanging out with Tim Leary and some other luminaries and they had synthetic psilocybin.[59:01] And that was pretty much the real beginning of his path.And sometimes I'm a little skeptical about this concept because I worry that, because I've met people who are really into psychedelics, who are somehow at one of the opposite direction.They're really kind of egoic, they're into the dosage, and how how many times they're very guru-like.They become guru.You know, by the way, guru isn't always bad, but they become narcissistic.They become power gurus, more like sorcerers and co-leaders.Co-leaders.And so, yeah, so I worry that, you know, because everyone's like, what if we just gave Putin a shitton of mushrooms?It's like, well, it's gonna go one of two ways.Like, it's gonna be like where you just like, it's like, oh my fucking god.Oh my fucking god.I thought I was Russian.I'm an earthling.[1:00:01] What the fuck was I think?This is, I was conditioned conditioned this is brainwashing I got brainwashed by culture and And it's over guys no more of this shit.I retire.I'm moving to fucking Hawaii Whatever but like the Eric goes the other way, which is like oh God wants me to fire nuclear missiles God wants me to fire nuclear missiles.You know what I mean?You know, we don't know.Roll the dice.Right.Roll the dice.So, yeah, but I do think if we're looking at like massive, like instantaneous shifts in planetary consciousness, psychedelics, definitely one of the ways.Like, if you were to the brotherhood of eternal love No, but Don't I don't like the way it sounds.I think he'd like them The name it's like that sounds like the bad people in some really corny movie does brotherhood of eternal love You're the brotherhood of eternal love speaking of which I saw a really good movie last night what um [1:01:06] What it is I think it's called, Late Night with the Devil.It's about, it's a 2020 form movie about a talk show host in 1977 that has this girl come on the show.And it's like really done, like it looks like you're in 1977.Okay.And the girls possessed.And it like, like it builds man.Dude, it's so fucking good.Have you seen this?Yes.Oh, you loved it, right?Dude, I loved it.It's great.It's so good.The night with the devil officially, I mean, I think it just came out a couple months ago.I must have just went straight to being streamed, but it's fucking good, man.And that's good casting, dude.All of it, like that, the host is so much like that level talk show host from that time period.And it's scary and it's fucking good.Yeah, it's solid.Highly recommend.Yeah, it was solid.It was really solid.Solid, dude.Dude, you know what I just saw?[1:02:00] That, and I was super skeptical about this one.But it's not bad.The Pope's exorcist.Have you seen that?Did I know, I had the same thinking, my brother-in-law who's got really good taste in movies and he's like, it's actually not that bad.It's a little cheesy.It's fucking good, dude.Really?Yes, it's very good.But stupid, but good.You know what I mean?Like, this is the Pope's exercise?Yeah, and I usually don't get into Russell Crowe.I don't get into exercise movies usually.Why do they all fucking turn their head like that?But what's interesting is this guy, the Pope, has an exercise and he wrote a bunch of fucking books.And so it's kind of drawing from like stories of this guy doing exorcisms.And it's fascinating man, it's really interesting.It would be the greatest deception ever if demonic possession was real and we were all mocking [1:03:00] it.And then one day you saw it.You actually saw it.You were like, oh no, it's real.Dude, I think it is real.Like, I think we've just come up with new words for it.But have you ever had this happen?I'm gonna get made fun of this.Have you ever had this happen?Have you ever been like super high?You're walking down the street.You pass somebody having a psychotic episode.And they start saying what you're thinking.If you ever have that happen.No.I have.Really?Yeah.I have what you're thinking though.I'm hot.I feel crazy.I was thinking, I feel crazy.I feel crazy.I'm hot!You're like, oh my god, he knows he agreed with my mind.I'm too high right now!How he can read my mind.No, no, it was like, no, he was like kind of like, he was like garbling out like shit.I think I was thinking about like, I mean, obviously any of this stuff, it's not scientific.Obviously, he's not scientific.Wait a minute, you're not a scientist.I am a scientist.I am actually, yeah, I am a fucking scientist.[1:04:06] I study rainbows.I study the power of rainbows to heal animals.There is, I forget who posted it up with just some video of all these college kids talking about, it went viral.All these college kids talking about what their degree was in and all these woke kids with these ridiculous degrees, like what they studied.Yeah, man.Dude, very expensive to get those fucking degrees.It is a hilarious video, because it's like, how does anybody not see that that is a massive waste of your time?Like, what have you done?You have been tricked.You have been tricked into getting a degree in nonsense?Dude.And right, papers in nonsense and books on nonsense.But aside from that, you know what you've really been tricked into?You've become a fucking vassal of the banks.Like you are eternally indebted to the structures [1:05:01] that you are opposing.It's like, oh, what's your oh so you Spent how much again like a hundred and eighty thousand dollars to get to major and like communist studies Great, okay You're late on your payment You got to pass now.I mean not only that.It's the ultimate mafia group.Like they want your money no matter what.Even if social security, fuck you, pay me.They're the ultimate fuck you, pay me, people.Fuck you, pay me.You can't, apparently we talked about this before, but apparently there are certain circumstances under which there's a certain type of bankruptcy that'll allow you to evade that, but I wonder what that is.It's suicide.This is a fucking stupid form of podcast, but I don't understand enough to interrupt.Yeah, I remember us talking about it.I'm gonna understand it either.Dude, this is like, man, what we've definitely talked about this before, but rest in peace, David Graber, [1:06:01] or a great book called Bullshit Jobs.Brilliant mind, man, Brilliant mind, but he basically talks about how like, so ideas, I'm gonna go to college.Oh, discharge.No problem, man.Discharge and bankruptcy.If you declare bankruptcy and then the bankruptcy court determines repaying your loans would cause undue hardship, your loans can be discharged.How many times is that happen zero it's like it yeah it's legal long as judge decides i'm sorry but repaying your loans always produces undue fucking hardship it sucks to pay back loans it sucks it always sucks i want to fucking nice money about i want to swimming boy like for example several types of loans associated with education expenses are dischargable in bankruptcy like most other types of unsecured consumer debt.These types of loans for education expenses are not subject to the more difficult standard and extra step.These loans could include, for example, loans where the loan amount was [1:07:03] higher than the cost of the attendance such as tuition, books, rooms, and board, which can occur when a loan is paid directly to a consumer, loans pay for education.So that means they could do it, they could forgive you if the loan amount was higher than the cost of attendance, is that what it's saying?Or is it saying it's going to pay you the difference?Like you could deduct the difference when you get a bankruptcy.Lowens to pay for education at places that are not eligible for title for funding include unaccredited colleges, a school in a foreign country.So so much for your wizard university Duncan, you can't go bankrupt with your wizard degree.You still have to pay.Are you fucking kidding?You have to pay.You have to pay.You have to pay.In debt for this shit.It says you have to pay.And also it's like.It's unaccredited, Duncan.But the rainbow thing, it's like something's changed in the earth's atmosphere because It's not healing anymore.It's an unaccredited wizard school.Yeah, you went cheap and now you're fucked.[1:08:06] Well, I'm sorry, Joe.Not everybody who is born a billionaire like you.I wasn't born a billionaire.I know you weren't, I'm joking.I don't think that wizard stuff is good anyway.I think it's healing.I think you're toying with the devil.Just like that late night show.I'm that little bald guy.Okay.I was like, in the show, that's me.Well, I'm like, hey, you're messing with something.Can I ask you something?Yes.Where did the devil come from?That's a good question.Did God make the devil?What a mean trick.Right?Imagine.Do you need the devil?Do you need, is it symbolic of what we need in this life?Like, do we need to see what's happening in Palestine in order to reassess the way we behave as a civilization?Do we need crime to get out of hand before we realize that law and order is important?[1:09:00] And that we really need to like figure out a way to stop crime at its root source, which is disenfranchised people.Do we really need to like figure out a way to stop crime at its root source, which is disenfranchised people.Do we really need something?Like maybe that's the only way we learn.That's maybe there's like, you know, like lottery winners, they don't do well, dude.They don't do well because they didn't learn.They just got all this money like, wow, another Joe and blow and they're out of fucking rotten.It's gone.No, it's gone.And now you're mad and everybody's mad at you and you didn't invest in the business with your uncle.And everybody's pissed at you.So you're asking, do we need the devil?I wonder if you need a bad and a good.I wonder if you need something.I wonder if you need to see 200 plus thousand dead people and just have that number in your head and just try to picture what that looks like.I wonder if we need that in order to realize, yes, yes, that there's like, you don't grow without resistance.Like, this is, we're thinking of it as just playing, this is life, but we're in the middle of a process.Yeah.[1:10:01] We're in the middle of a process.Everyone understands this and no one thinks about it.We are in the middle of this intellectually evolutionary process.And there's something...That's funny that I said, those two words in such a goofy way.Intellectual evolution.But there's a thing going on where we're assuming that civilization is going to be better all the time and we're always going to get better all the time, which is really interesting, because no other animal does that.There's not another animal alive that says we only killed 47 zebras this year.Next year we're fucking cranking it up, we're going to be better and more efficient.We want to be better at everything.We want to be better at our industry, we're gonna be better and more efficient.We wanna be better at everything.We wanna be better at our industry.We wanna be better at fixing our infrastructure.We wanna be better at housing.We wanna be better all the time.Like there's this constant push for progress.And if you just step back and look at where there's going with this train wreck of AI happening at the same time, [1:11:00] that's going on.It's like, oh, we were fueling this.Yeah, we're fueling the takeover.We were buying iPhones dude I think this is so funny you're mentioning this because honestly, it's so embarrassing It's this is so dumb.I don't care.I'm wearing a robot outfit.I had the gym yesterday And the gym yesterday, I'm working out and I've started listening to classic gospel music.Whoa.It is so good.If you're having a shitty day, it doesn't matter if you're not Christian, just fucking listen to it.It's so upbeat.And like it makes you happy and it's kind of magical.But like, so I'm at the gym and I'm thinking about Jesus because I've been listening to gospel music.And like I was thinking like, so I'm at the gym and I'm thinking about Jesus because I've been listening to gospel music and like, I was thinking like, oh, oh, like maybe the idea as far as like the devil goes because I always wonder that who made the devil?Why did God make the devil?Why is there a devil?Is there a devil?Is it just a fucking symbol for something?But I realized like, oh, like, you know that stupid song, if you love somebody, set them free.[1:12:07] Yeah.So it's like the idea being, I'm making you, you're sentient.I'm setting you free.And I'm setting you free in a fucking universe where there are, there's collectivized evil.There's some kind of like, like, semantics.There's some kind of thing that forms, which will fuck you up.And because I love you, I'm gonna let you figure it out.And then, from that perspective, and also if there is some super intelligence, and somehow in the universe, there's a bifurcation or something that's centered on the self instead of others that has an intelligence to it to really like fucking flex to that thing.You're like, okay, I'm just going to give you these things that I love so much.And if you when, if you corrupt my creation fully, then you win.[1:13:07] I was wrong, but I don't think you are.I don't think it's gonna happen.Because inevitably, whatever it is, you take a psychedelic, for me whenever I take psychedelics, too many, right away I start thinking about how selfish I am.I start thinking like, dude, like it hurts.It hurts to be jealous.It hurts to be jealous.It hurts to not help.It hurts to be so cherishing of myself.And anytime I'm not doing that, I'm so happy.Like so, but to force that out, you can't force that out of somebody.They have to stumble upon it somehow.And there's like, that's Christianity.That's- They don't get it unless they feel it.That's it.And so to let these things, theoretically, I'm talking about from Christian cosmology, that you love more than anything else, to fuck it, which by the way, like in the Garden of Eden story, when God says something like, where are you to Adam and Eve?And apparently the original translation [1:14:09] that crying out is the way of, like you know, if you ever lost your kid at a playground, it's that.It's not like, where are you slaves?It's like when you're calling for your kids.So yeah, it's heavy, man.And so like, so yeah, I feel like that maybe the whole thing is designed for us individually to stumble upon that basic truth that underneath the shell is love.And the love wants to express itself and love doesn't express itself by saying, me, me, me, me, me, me.Love is always like, I love you.What can I do for you?Let me help you.It's like the person swimming into the lake for no reason to get that last person who fucking was in a car accident.And they drown.You know, they get the person to save you and they die.This is, to me, I think that's the devil, that's why it's there.It's, it might be real.I think it's a term of convenience, it's great.[1:15:07] But it's like, holy shit man, like, as an inclination, it's real, right?Like whether or not you murder a baby because the devil made you do it or because some other force that is just like the devil that just happens to be a part of human beings, and violent rages they could do horrific things.And then on top of that, also intentionally evil, just like chimpanzees.I mean chimpanzees do it.Do we think that devil's invading the chimps when they're doing it?Or do we think that this is some bygone, some leftover shit that's in our DNA that can go sideways and allow people to become serial killers.You do.A lot of people to become assassins.I think it's a semantics argument.I think it's like, it's an identification of a possibility in a human life.There is a possibility in a human life to make a series of shitty decisions.[1:16:01] And those shitty decisions lead you into darker and darker and darker experiences of reality and the darker your experience of reality, the more likely you are to make a shitty decision because like you've gotten yourself into fucking debt, you went to wizard school, you've got your study fucking rainbow magic, it doesn't seem to be real, no one's coming to your clinic, now you're like 800,000 dollars in fucking debt and now what are you going to fucking do?You've got to figure000 in fucking debt.And now what are you gonna fucking do?Like you gotta figure out a way to make money.So how are you gonna make the fucking money?Well, you find some scam or some shit, right?And then the next thing you know, now you're like lying to people.And now that you're lying to people, you have to keep fucking lying to people.And then you start lying to yourself.And then you get lost of self deception that leads you into lower and lower and lower levels of consciousness.Until the next thing you know, you're in fucking jail or you're dead, you're killing somebody.And so like, you call it whatever you want to fucking call it, but this entropic reality in human existence is very fucking real.And the message of all the great lineages, whether it's Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, [1:17:04] is at any given moment in that hell state you've gotten yourself into.There is a way to get the fuck out.You don't have to be in hell.It's like what C.S.Lewis says, the gates of hell are locked from the inside.There's a fucking way out.It's so good dude.It's so good.It's so good.That's a good one.And that's you know that's that's why I love Jesus.That's why I love the message of praise.Praise God.I heard that song right?Yeah dude I'm like.That song is fucking great.It shows up on my gospel playlist isn't it weird that that guy like that was it?There was like that was his song.It's just like this one song that was a banger, but you listen to the rest of them.Oh, that sucks.Oh, God, man.That's the worst.There's a few of those guys that we find.You know, Johnny Thunder, you know that song I'm alive.No, I played that song for so many fucking people, including musicians, you know, I played it for Zach Brian.He was like, woo!Like you hear it, people like, God damn![1:18:06] And it's from 1969.One-hit wonder.Dude, I don't even think it was a hit.There was another version of it that his version of Amalive was a cover of.And it was better than the original version.And it was so good.You're like, if this guy can make this song, somebody needs to write for him, man.This guy's a star.This guy's got bangers.I mean, this was a fucking tremendous song, and it was just one.Dude, I know, it's like, that's got, that just is like, it's gotta be so scary, man.Like, you know, when you make a great movie, and then you gotta make your next movie, and like, it's gotta be fucking good.Like say you make that movie, what's it called, Deus Ex Machina?You know that movie?Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.And you're like, you're, I gotta make another movie.And then you're like civil war.And oh fuck.Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Sorry.That's the guy, right?I'll look scarlet.[1:19:05] Oh, no.Man, I'm sorry, I'll look scarlet.By the way, you're brilliant.Like I get it.Like the attempt, I get it.And who knows?You never know what happened in the process.And like, man, I feel like now this is so, I'll start doing video.And I'm recognizing just like how hard it is just to like get the lighting right from my dumb ass and then they're rambling like anyone who makes a fucking movie is a genius fucking wizard So I do and all the people that come together some of them just don't work out the way they want to work out They just don't work out that's how it is like like pilots for TV shows It's for sketches that people create yeah, yeah, you know, but like I just like I think doing a video podcast and then critiquing a great director is pretty fucked up man.I just I don't mean I just in a lot of people like the movie but um you try to dig yourself out.I'm just so bad.I feel bad.No, but God damn it was horrible.[1:20:06] It was so bad.It was so bad.Oh my god, this is funny.Yeah, I'm glad I didn't see it.No, you're lucky to see it.You've been watching the gentlemen on Netflix.Now what's that?Oh, dude.It's a Guy Richie series on Netflix.It's fucking amazing.What is it?It's about these weed growers in the UK.Cool.I don't want to give away any more of it, but it's basically the movie the gentlemen.I don't know if you ever saw the movie, but this is the same world that the movie takes place in just with different characters.Cool.It's fucking great, man.It's great, Joe.I think it has like six episodes or how many episodes did I have?Eight.There's some good movies coming out right now, man.[1:21:01] It's kind of awesome.We went through like a pretty rough, sentiment drought.I don't know, do you remember?COVID, I mean, you gotta think about how many movies get, they get drawn up, they get funded.COVID hits, everything gets shut down.Everything gets shut down.And then everybody loses money.No one's going to the movies anymore.Everything's fucked.Yeah, that's sad.You know, this is so fucking...I haven't seen it but it hurts also.They start making movies like that.They start making Banger movies again.Dude, Dune 2 is so fucking good.I watched it with a song and dude, I was like, you know that, like you get bliss and movies are so good and you're the right amount of stone.And like you realize like, oh my god, it's only been 30 fucking minutes and this is already the most insanely beautiful thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.The soundtrack.When you look up how they made the soundtrack for that movie, it is insane, man.[1:22:03] Everything about it is like they had throats singing in it.They've got like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, everything about it is like, they had throats singing in it, they've got like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't read that.Frank Herbert, it's one of the best sci-fi books I've done.I think I've read...I think I've read one of those.Do they make me into like comic books, like really nice comic books?Probably.Did they?But you can't, I never got into the first one.The first movie, so when the second one came around, I was like, ah!Oh, dude.I keep hearing this amazing.Second one's better than the first and the first was great.If you're like a doon nerd, which I am, but like- Like you're a doon nerd.Oh I'm a doon nerd, I've been reading that book since- Oh what interesting.Dude, the spice m'launch.And like, but the way he's, first really respect, Stamets talks about it like I think yeah.[1:23:06] Yeah.And whoa.Duncan, this is what gonna happen when Trump wins.Ha ha ha.Robert De Niro is right.Robert De Niro is right Robert De Niro is right Duncan Do you want to line up and lose all your rights?And he never leaves the White House and you have throat singing on the Capitol Hill step you So funny I was like dude that sounds awesome Make a mess over Everybody's nothing gets a gun Make a mess over there, get it, get it, get it.Yeah, you make me, you make me money, you sneak thing, get to gun, grinds it in the morning, grinds it in the morning.You sneak in, we'll give you money.It's gonna be a good game, vote for us.Dude, yeah, so like the, there's always theories about doing it.But the blue eyes, so you eat this spice melange [1:24:07] that like, that you need it for space travel.It's only produced on, you know the story, but like the blue eyes.So there's a theory, because he was Frankervo's a mycologist.The blue eyes represent psilocybin.And like that was his moulange is like psilocybin.And like, yeah dude.And he apparently, I think it's Sam Fran, he was living on a boat next to Alan Watts.Oh.And they were, they were fucking friends.So a lot of the, like, you remember the gummujer bar, the needle that that witch puts to Paul the tradies neck to say, like they wanna find out if you're human, so you put your hand in this box that if you pull your fucking hand out of the box, she stabs you with this needle, it kills you because you're not human, who gives a fuck.And so, gom jibar, gom is into betting Buddhism as the name for meditation.So there's all these, like clearly, [1:25:01] it was pals on the wads lots and he like like weaves a lot of like the lot of the language in it is like the The daughter in the womb.I think her name is Alia Which is like a Buddhist term for like the emptiness for a state of pure consciousness And so it's a deep book is my point and you know you would love it and it inspired Star Wars, right?Didn't we just talk about this we did right?Don't get my no more about that, but it was that they came from the same thing, I think.What do you mean?Dune and Star Wars came from the same place, like they both and they were inspired by the same thing.I asked that question out loud.I thought I thought we talked about it the other day.Did we not talk about it on the podcast?Okay, we did, right?But I think it was, Dune came before Star Wars, and then Star Wars was written by different people.I don't know.I think Dune predates Star Wars for sure.Yeah, Dune predates Star Wars.We talked about it the other day.What is the whole story though?What were you trying to say?I didn't understand what you're saying.I had asked that out loud.I said, isn't Dune just, or Star Wars is a Dune rip off?And then I dug into it and it says that they both, [1:26:07] like I'm sorry, both creators took similarities and inspiration from the same original source.I think it's, but what's the original source?I'm trying to read as I'm talking, that's what I'm saying.Oh, so there's something else.There was an original story like that.I'm sorry.It's like a short story.Dude is influenced.Probably, it's like the greatest sci-fi book, if you ask me, and it's influenced all sci-fi.It's so fucking good, dude.And did you see David Lynch's, dude?No.Oh, man.You gotta watch.Sting is in David Lynch's, dude.And like, Man, I did see it.That was the original one, right?The Lynch one was the original one.Yeah, and I didn't get into it.No, well, it was massively criticized because like there have been attempts to do Dune.This famous guy, Jotarowski, there's a whole documentary on his idea for Dune.David Lynch takes on the project.And where the Dune we have now succeeds [1:27:02] where he failed is they broke the book into two movies.Every sci-fi property you love is based on foundation.And you're asking?Isaac Asimov's foundation series is widely understood to be the inspiration for Star Wars Dune and even the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.Wow.You know one of the things about the new Dune is the people that grime me.Right.They look like they're really in that world.There was a thing about those old dunes that I couldn't get into, because everybody looked too clean.Everybody looked like they just stepped right out of wardrobe.I just didn't, you know what I'm saying?Like you see that when the guys throat singing and those people were walking down and putting, everybody's dirty.Yeah, it's cool.They're grimy.That's a, yeah.You live in a crazy, fucked up, hard ass life.Yeah, yeah.And like in the book, even in the newest one, I don't think they can vey like he writes about the smell in those speeches in the underground, like, [1:28:00] in the caves that the Fremen are living in.He talks about the smell of the bio and they're like just all of these people living underground and the stink of that But dude, did you see that video of David Lynch eating a girl eating this girl's panties?What No For real yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm actually doing that Jamie do you want one of this you want to Lucy?Yeah, let me spit this thing out Renegade rogue.Thank you.Hey, do you know the Zen conspiracy?Do you know about this?We're all being accused of secretly being sponsored by Zen Yeah, it's the funniest shit.Okay, watch this.This is crazy.Okay.This would be being dedicated to Deb.Dude, is that not real?That's a eyebrow god damn it.I don't know, ma'am.He's looking forward to this When did when was it posted?Yeah, no look because this just stood up There I did see multiple videos or versions of the video too.It just looked like his mouth was moving weird [1:29:04] I mean, I hope it's real.Thank you very much.They're still warm Okay now The very warm is matter of fact cinnamon okay, and now The deal is I'm going to put these panties in my mouth And for now's WMM's full username.Are you ready?He's a genius.What the fuck, dude?I love him.down.Okay that that's probably one of them frequencies that called the devil.Like that sound that's probably what the devil responds to.If you have a mouthful of panties you try to read anything the devil's like I got you.I got you now.That's a sound of God.This is a sound that you make.Like a sound you make with a mouthful of panties.[1:30:07] I just imagine, demons just summon, and they're like, we were waiting for you to open the portal.Like you have to make that sound.Like the only way to make that sound is to be such a deprave fuck.Do you have someone's panty stuffed in your mouth?May I stop you there?I don't think it's the prey to shove a beautiful woman's pain either but the devil thinks that it is and God thinks it is.Well, if they agree, like this is an opportunity to go after him.Look, this guy's out there eating people's underwear.Let me tell you he's not going to solve the world's problems.He's so crazy he's eating underwear.Why does everybody want to solve the world's problems?Let's shove it.We're all in this together, Duncan.I wanna eat panties.We are on the production line for AI, and you're not doing your part.Dude, I, listen, if there is a Satan, he doesn't want us to put panties in our mouth.That's what the devil would really be.The devil would really be anti panties in mouth, and be like, don't ever.He would want you on Adderall and you want you working 24 hours a day?Exactly.Yeah.Exactly.[1:31:05] The devil doesn't want us, the devil hates David Lynch.If there is a devil, he doesn't like David Lynch.Right, because he's having fun.Stuffed warm panties in his mouth.Yeah.It happened in 2000.Two or three.Back when it was legal.What if that was illegal?Well, the point of if you fucking develop laws for panty eating like enough we've summoned too many demons It's the way it's like people just realized that all you have to do is like and hold hands with mouthfuls of panties And if the two of you are talking at the same time you could summer a super demon dude Like it is kind of I mean like that's a that was a that wasn't like a dainty panty like he's stuffed a real panty in there that wasn't a G string that was like he was like back a little bit of a back to it like and then to still be able to talk oh yeah what a genius he's so good he's so good really good at talking dude I'm he's the best [1:32:00] the portal's open Oh my God.Ah, the pot of soap.Ah, the maaah!Twin Peaks was great.Creatures hiding in your closet.David, thank you for bringing me.Yeah.Thank you, Dave.I have an idea for your next job.What are you talking about?Sound you make with a mouthful of panties.Dude, yeah, well, I mean, look, this is the thing.Like, David Lynch is one of the great artists alive today.And this thing where we expect artists to behave like normal people.Yeah, I don't expect that at all.Fuck it, not you, but like you read the comments and people are like, oh, they're so mad at them, I'm sure.But I don't have to read it.But it just says, this is like, that's just what it is.And it's also not representative, I think, of actual, a real number of actual people.The problem is, it's like, whatever you do a survey, people say, oh, the survey is like, no, you don't get a real percentage.I don't give a fuck what your study says.You only get 100% of the people that are on your survey are so fucking dumb that [1:33:10] they reply to surveys.Yes.This is not everybody.Exactly.It's not even close.Exactly.It's just like comments.Who the fuck leaves comments?How do you have time?I think about that.Unless you're like, good job.Congratulations.It's being nice.Who has time?Yeah.If you do, there's no chance you're devoting the proper amount of time to the things in your life that you should.Right.So it's this massive distraction and you get these arguments online that distract you from the failures in your real life.But that is representative in a lot of people's minds to how people think about whatever this person posted or whether this political argument that people are having about things.But that's not real.And then you've got the algorithm manipulation we were talking about, which is even more crazy.Now not only do you have the most complaining, [1:34:01] fucking people complaining, but you have the algorithm showing things that gonna piss you off like, look at this fucking out.And the phone's gonna know that you took a screenshot of the comment and you sent it to me.And I'm like, wow, what a dick.And I'll send it to other people.I'll send people a link.Look at this moron.He's arguing people in the comments.Yeah, that's it.And that's a neurological hurricane sweeping through brains around the planet.Amygdala's fucking squirtin', fucking quarters all.Hanger, teams, fucking get ready to do battle.For fucking what?Yeah, dude.For what?What are you arguing about?So this is, I've heard, I don't know if you've heard about this, like there's some, the kids now, I'm 50, so I could say that for sure.The kids.The kids now are apparently there's a whole new thing where they're just, they're putting their phones down.There's this whole thing where they're just like, fuck this.My friend was still.Really?Yes, that's what I heard that like, you're dealing with a lot of weird kids though.Well, I'm not dealing with any kids.Like my friend.He knew it hippies.They got fucking straw hats on.They're in the woods barefoot.Yeah, well, but I like tie dyed mushroom shirts on.[1:35:06] If you think about it, like what do kids tend to do?Like what I did, rebel.And so like you're, so you're like God help you.Let's imagine you're raised by like an influencer mom.God help you.So your whole childhood has been on camera.And if it's not on camera, you're looking at your fucking mom staring at the comments of the video she posted if you open in Christmas presents.Or you're just a standard kid and your childhood is constantly interrupted by your parents staring at their fucking phones.So you get old enough, you're not gonna associate phones necessarily with good feelings.And then you're like, you know what, fuck these things.This made my parents fucking like distant.It made my parents upset.And they're just like fuck this, which means there's by the way, that's scary if you want to monitor populations.[1:36:00] Wow.Right now we're all in fucking Orwell, like some crazy version of 1984, way more sinister than the camera in your house.It's like you're carrying it around, but suddenly these like formerly monitored populations, they just go dark, because like kids are just like, I'm not gonna do this, they're meeting in parks, God help us all, they're meeting in parks, and they're saying things that are untraceable.No one knows what they're talking about.And so now you've got these?Yeah.I like to believe you're correct.This sounds like a movie.This is from a Pew Research.72% of US teens say they often and sometimes feel peaceful when they don't have their smartphone.44% say it makes them feel anxious.Good for a hobby's less so for socialization.69% of teens say smartphones make it easier for youth to pursue hobbies and interests.True, right?That's a good aspect of it.A few or 30% say it helps people their age learn good social skills.That's true.It doesn't do that, right?Parental snooping, that's a problem.Half of parents said they'd look through their teens' phone.[1:37:05] You're going to find a lot of dicks.The other half are liars.About four in ten parents and teens regularly arguing with one another about time spent on their phone.Nearly half of teens, 46% say their parent is at least sometimes distracted by their phone when they're trying to talk to them.At what age do you think Felistar said in dick pics?Do you think they wait until it's legal?Would you?I don't think they do.So here's the thing.Like, you know, there was a girl that was charged with, she was charged with child pornography.I think she was 15 because she was sending naked photos of her body to other boys.So like she was the pornography and the pornographer.Right.That's so fucked up.Find that story, see if you can find that story because it was like a national outrage story because everybody's like, hey, hey, hey, man.She's fucking 15.[1:38:00] She's not a child porn producer.Like this is a bastardization of the law.Like this is just a girl's being silly.That's insane.She's not a child porn producer like this is a bastardization of the law like this is just a girl's being silly That's insane.She's getting a little wild.That is that's Terrifying she might have been talked into it like who the fuck knows like what is did she go to jail?I don't know what the story of a 17 year old boy who is charged no no no girls a 15 they dropped the charges in this case Oh, okay, but find the one on the 15 year old girl I'm trying to remember with the the Thing is not the easiest thing to dig through looking for child porn's no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 15 year old girl convicted for child porn You say that and you just scared to type it you gotta be careful with the words you look for I'll Google it you pussy Google's already like, they're taking everything.You have ever Googled.I typed in and I'm just showing you a popped up.Kid charged with child porn.How about 16 year old male?I understand.How about Google 15 year old girl charged with child porn?[1:39:02] Girl.Teen girl chargedger Child porn.There it is.That's it.That's the girl.There's another one.There's more than one.There was different cases.Oh, revenge porn.Oh, wait a minute.This is different.This is a 15 year old girl who's accused of requesting and sending nude photos to classmates under the identity of her ex-boyfriend.Oh!Oh!Oh!Is facing multiple child porn charges.What a demon.She was sending them to classmates under the identity of her ex-boyfriend.Wow.How was she doing that?Fucking.So she was pretending that she was him and she was sending naked photos of herself to try to charge him for it.Oh, she was trying to nail him.Dude, she's a monster.Oh, look at this.She told police that she created a fake social account for revenge for the relationship ending [1:40:02] with her ex-boyfriend.What a psycho.She also admitted she was jealous that her ex-boyfriend chose him to perform a solo in state finals for band.What happened?She was the crazy bitch for band camp monster.Remember that movie one time in band camp?Yes.Yes.Wow.What a psychopath.She's only been on the planet 15 years and she's reached peak evil.That is so crazy.Imagine trying to set your boyfriend up with child porn.Oh God damn it dude that is Was it was it like Dr.Phil Kaye same thing?I don't know what that story is here is that the same gal?No, I probably not as they're talking to her look at that.She's got a cover of horns with fucking Wow, I think she was in late night with the devil wow That's so crazy that someone could be that evil at that age.Yeah, well, it's so that's such a great But then again, I mean you ever see that movie city of God [1:41:03] It's the gang movie from Brazil, from the Favellas.Woo!I say it's like one of the wildest gang movies I've ever seen in my life.It's probably the wildest.Yeah.Now that's based on real life in the Favellas, in some places.So that's a real, that's people really living it that way.Like you gotta imagine, that's just you just become a sociopath at a very early age, people with psychopath at a very early age.The only way to stay a lot.Yep.And then what are those ways to go through?Or she's, she's so conniving.She's gonna set up fake social media accounts.Yeah.And then get her boyfriend accused of child porn.Yeah.What?Yeah, how distanced are you from like the fact that?Fadeevious.Very fucking devious.How devious.How devious.Dude, if you read the painted bird, no.Don't, I mean, it's so good, but it's the most like, it's like, it doesn't matter if you do spoilers for old books, [1:42:01] but like, one of the of the scenes, it's about a kid wandering, like I think it's World War II, he's lost his parents and he's got to like, he's just wandering through the countryside and seeing just the most horrific shit you've ever seen and surviving.But like he watches these villagers take a woman and shove a bottle into her pussy and then stop on her pussy to break the bottle inside of her.Yeah, dude.And that's not even the worst thing in the book.But so, so this innocent kid just is witnessing all of it and it's talking about what you're talking about.It's like basically analyze, it's sort of like showing like, where does evil come from?You know, are people born evil?Statistically, some people are born sociopaths.We know that, but it's a relatively small part of the population, but where does it come from?And inevitably, it comes from trauma [1:43:00] that a kid is enduring, and then you have to survive.Just like your saying, you were programmed to fuck us around.And it's self-obituating.It's gonna continue because they're all gonna see people murdered.It's like people living in gang-infested neighborhoods in America.Same thing.You're seeing it happen all the time and it's affecting all those families.It's gonna just keep rate.The kids are gonna go into it.They see the drug dealer rolls by in the nice car.Yeah, everybody else is a sucker forgetting on the train.Yeah.And then everybody's in.And then the next thing you know you're dead.And then it just keeps going.And you have kids that are raised without you.And then you're, it's like, whoo!And then what do you do?So then what happens that reaction to the contagion is you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you like monster-fives somebody, you got to fucking forget how they became the monster.[1:44:06] And then this is where you end up with a very non nuanced system of dealing with the contagion, which will produce more contagion.This just spreads the fucking evil all over the fucking place.And I grew with you, man.I don't know the solution.This I know, but in, like, you know, this is where imaginary numbers came up with, you know, and math.It's like, you don't need to know the solution.Put an X there.It's like, clearly, this is a fucking problem.We've got this, the people who are horrifically traumatized.And then from, it made shitty decisions where they've got to commit to being some violent monstrous, thieving piece of shit and rationalize it and justify it.But this is, if we could fix this problem, and I don't think the way we fix the fucking problem is dropping bombs on people.[1:45:01] You're not fixing the problem like if the answer to evil is more evil, what the fuck?It's like a never ending, it's like scratching poison ivy.It's not going to go away.Right.And it actually makes more.Like this is the thing that people are talking about this, the Israel Hamas thing.Like how many, you know, who is it that told us about this the math?The way Killing to like terrorist math goes Was it Dave Smith?Probably Dave Smith sounds like some Dave Smith would talk about but essentially like if one terrorist dies It doesn't equal it you don't like lose one terrorist dies it doesn't equal You don't like lose a terrorist you gain ten because all the people that he's connected to they all become Radicalized they all want it you killed their friend you killed their family member kill their son They all so the you you gain more terrorist dude.It's a it's it's the worst fucking problem ever, man, [1:46:07] cause like, you know, like whenever, like no matter how horrific the monster is, or like whatever it is, I try to like not be afraid to put myself in the position of whatever the fucking thing is.And in this case, we've got two sides that right now seem to be being equally vilified by different groups of people, right?But man, dude, let me tell you something.If my fucking kid got blown up by a fucking bomb, right?That's it.My logic's out the window.I would like to think that I'd really listen to all the Ramdas retreats and stuff.And I'd like to think that I would be like Gandhi or have some blossom of love and be like, I forgive everyone.I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.I'm gonna wanna hurt.And then if my fucking kid got dragged into a fucking tunnel, are you fucking kidding me, man?[1:47:01] I'm not gonna see clearly.Like, I'm going to want revenge and I want my kid back.And whatever you do to get my fucking kid back, okay, like, have you seen the last of us?Like, so what were, so this fucking like, othering of whatever the fucking side is, is just leaving out like, what it feels like to love your kid.And like, like, look at a mother like it's throughout the animal kingdom.Don't fuck with a creature's kid.Like I'm sorry it will get you fucked up even if the thing smaller than you and you fuck with its kid it will like put itself in front of its kid.So like we are looking at a problem of love sadly, which is like on both sides people love their fucking kids and it's been like, I can't imagine how a day goes by.When you're fucking kids in a tunnel, [1:48:00] I can't imagine how a day goes by.When you're thinking about how this thing that you fucking love more than anything in the world got its head fucking blown off in a fucking explosion in a building.I don't know how you live one day like that, right?So like when you look at that, the entirety of the thing is heartbreaking and irrational.Both sides are, it's pure, it's completely irrational because both sides are trying to put out a fire with more fire.And it's like, that's what it is.Dude.That's what it is, what you just said.Yeah, man.That's what it is.Yeah.Put out a fire with more fire.And that, we've tried it a million times throughout human history to put out the fire with fucking fire.And at the very best, the fire will temporarily abate, but then it springs right the fuck back up.And so, and again, to me, I don't know the solution.And that's the ex, it's like, but maybe the path [1:49:03] to the solution is let yourself feel it entirely for both for the whole fucking thing.Feel the whole thing, you know?And don't like, you know?And again, if you're like these motherfuckers, fuck them, fuck them, more fire.Your fuck them is the same thing causing the wars, right?Well, it's a problem when human beings don't know human beings and they're the enemy that doesn't make any sense.Regardless of how you think about religion and land, just stop for a second.Human beings that don't know other human beings and hate them so much they want to kill them.Like seems that's a communication issue.Dude, that seems like the power of Babel shit.Like the only way it makes sense.If we really get to a point, and I don't think it's going to be far from now, where we're all connected with real-time translation in real-time, somehow or another.I mean, they've already been able to do it with Google.[1:50:02] You know, they're already doing it with Samsung phones where they can translate conversations.You could be talking in Italian.I could be talking in English, you'll translate back and forth to both of us.It's wild what they're already able to do.If we can get to some sort of, I mean, it's not out of the question that if they do develop these neural implants and there's not just neural link, there's several competing companies that are trying to do the same thing.Because they've recognized that once you can actually affect the human mind with electronics and you can develop a symbiotic relationship with electronics, you could do some wild shit.And one of the things is you're gonna be able to talk without words.You're gonna be able to, well, if you're talking without words, what language is that in?Are you hearing that in a language or are you understanding what the person's thinking?So this is the difference.If you're talking without words, what's the problem is how are we gonna be able to translate all these different languages and dialects?We're not.We're gonna go on thoughts.We're gonna ditch language.And we're gonna go straight to thoughts.And we're gonna interface with each other [1:51:00] in a completely different way.So instead of thinking, you're reading people's minds, hey Duncan, would you like to go get pizza?Yeah, dude, are you reading my mind?No.Instead of that, it's like, I think your thoughts, you think my thoughts, we think together.So we abandon language.Yeah.There's no more need for that.That's it.You have AI that deals with mathematical problems, yeah, and structures and construction of things, and then we just live in a world of thoughts with no language.We're one thing now.And then we're fucked, because then you can't go back.You go back, you feel like you're just like walking when you just got out of a car.Yes.What the fuck, dude, I just drove, it took me two hours to get to Vegas in this car.If I walk, it's to take years.Dude, I might die.This is why I think world peace is possible because if you fucking look at what's happening, the system, it's like the framework is being built for just what you're talking about.The technological framework for a state, you to get into that state, you either need [1:52:02] to do a lot of psychedelics or a lot of meditation to really realize, like you're me, I'm you.But the technological framework is forming for this thing to happen, which is why, man, like everyone fucking, I'm gonna seem like a musk fanboy in a Tesla suit.Everyone bash and fucking musk.It's like, dude, do you understand like what he's, what that in the future, when people look back on that shit, even if it doesn't work, even if the things are coming unplugged, whatever the fucking thing is, if that leads to what you're talking about, God damn, that's electricity.That's like the end of war, that's the end of like, the ideological barrier.Like if, imagine, like whoever you hate the most in the fucking world, boop, put the thing on.You connect to them.This is real.And you just realize, Jesus fucking Christ, I see why they fucking hate me.And they're like, oh my God, I get why you're mad at me.I didn't mean it like that at all.And then, but how about you just completely abandon [1:53:01] everything and it just consciousness interacting with other consciousness which makes hate impossible.Yeah.Because there's no more annoying language, there's no more people that are incapable of communicating the thoughts.There's none of that stuff.There's all that gone.All that gone.Which is like, that's the problem of being like a communication bully.Like if you're a person and you know that you have a vastly superior, if you have a vocabulary like an Eric Weinstein, like for instance, imagine if Eric Weinstein decided to bully someone, like fucking Redban, you know?Who's a brilliant guy?But sometimes he stumbles on his words.Like if I have fucking Eric Weinstein's yelling at him with a bunch of long words, you go, hey, that guy's being an intellectual bully.You're not trying to communicate with him as a human being.You're trying to dominate him with your superior vocabulary.Exactly.And it's a weapon.And my vocabulary is like B plus.[1:54:01] It's not that good.It's pretty good.But for a guy who talks for 11, he probably should be better.You know?Because sometimes I get to words and I'm like, I thought, all right, all right.But I always say it.I'm not sure if that's the right word.But the point is that like it is a tool that you can wield to for the benefit of your ego, rather than just having a conversation.And those are the grossest conversations when someone's just jizzing on you, well I started a business, I sold it at $2 billion and now like a bro, I gotta go.You know those kind of people?Absolutely.That's what that is.That's their abusing communication in order to just, but if we get to a point where that never happens ever again because instantly we just think thoughts That's it and you realize like wine people's thoughts were all fucked up like oh my god You're the chemicals in your brain of course.Oh, what did you?What did your fucking neighbor do?What what happened to you?They got you so crazy When did you get dad get out of jail?What didn't do before you went to jail?[1:55:02] Oh my God.Too many people, dude.If that happened by some unknown fucking thing, like that's what the aliens did.Don't be it.But it would be like two days of crying.Yeah.Or hugging.Both.The whole planet would just be like, oh fuck.The thingiest man, the really fucked up thing is that's possible.You know, I've had moments where dudes were, I hated them and they hated me.And then we got together and we talked and we hugged and those are beautiful moments.And that's why I refuse to have feuds now as an older man who understands things.Like I don't care.Like I don't care.You could not like me, that's fine.That's okay.I'm not gonna attack you.I don't care, I'm not gonna do it publicly.I mean, I attacked CNN, but I felt like that was like a bigger thing.That was like, this is a real problem.Like this is not just my ego, which if they just attacked me and said, I suck, I'm like, okay, sorry, I suck.[1:56:01] You're lying about medicine.Like you're lying about medicine for the whole world.So that I've made a big deal out of those fuckers.Yes.But normally I'm like, there's the benefit of conflict in that regard.It's like almost zero benefit.All of my conflict, I try to keep internal.I don't want to have any conflict with external people.I want to have all my conflict with my own head.I want to have all my conflict with my own head.I wanna have all my conflict with discipline, all my conflict with being nice to people and like trying to be a better person all the time and trying to be wiser about my choices with how I describe things and talk about things and think of things and how I interface with ideas.I just try to be better at it.So I don't have any time.Dude, try your petty, bleau shit.There's just too many petty people out there.They're petty.They're petty and they usually petty because they're all fucked up.That's right.It's not going their way like that criticism thing.Dude, it's in also, I think I've yapped about this.You know, low-jong mind training you ever heard of that?I have, but I don't remember what it means.It's just like a slogan.It's all these slogans to sort of get you back on the path.[1:57:07] And one of my favorite Lo-jong slogans is drive all blames into oneself.So it defuses the, so it completely removes the ability to be like, it's your fault, because it's like, actually, whatever the fuck they did, it's kind of your fault.A vampire only goes where they're invited.You brought this person into your fucking life and they're behaving the way that your instincts told you they might behave.And now you're mad at them for being the fucking way they are.Drive all blames into oneself.So like anytime I'm getting like mad and butt hurt over this person or that person or this thing or that, if I really analyze the situation, I chose it.I chose to bring that person into my life.I chose to connect to that person in some way or another.This is all me and I'm choosing to fucking react [1:58:00] in a negative way.Yeah.So yeah man, this is like, you choose everything.Yeah.But you don't choose like random acts of violence and random catastrophes and random things that happen to you.But you do in some way, but you don't even choose like getting attached to a sociopath because if you're naive, you can get roped in.So this problem is what's thinking like this because you do have like really manipulative people, particularly like, you know, con people, con artists get you to sign over your fucking, I'm doing this business deal.She's just like, all you need is $2,000.I'll have you a quarter million dollars a month.Great, right?It sounds.It's really easy, it's really easy.I love it.I've been doing this for a while, I'm really good at it, but this one we're kind of like overdrawn.If you just do this for me, I am gonna take care of you in the most extreme way.Do you mean it?Yes, yes.I am a man of my work.And the next thing you know, you're signing off your back account and you don't was this cool guy you've been at a bar.He's a con artist and he does this to people.[1:59:05] Yeah, but this doesn't mean idiot compassion.This is not about letting someone fucking like walk all over you.That's not even an idiot thing.Sometimes it's like people get scared at people that are really confident and talk really well and they're just a little socially awkward.And they feel like it would be easier just to sign off and trust him then it would be to argue with him because he's so persistent right and you are so averse to conflict that when someone's like like being like really aggressive we have some someone to be really aggressive to try to get you invest in something yes it's the grossest feeling it's so fucked up you're like I gotta go I gotta go I hate I hate it.I don't make movies.Yeah, dude.I'm not man gonna move.It's so gross.It's so gross.And you can sense it.I don't know you.How am I starting a business with someone?I don't know.That sounds crazy.But everything in you, it feels like there's- I got a goal.You but you know, this is the thing, man.That's probably how girls feel at a bar.[2:00:06] Dude, that time's 100, right?Like the feeling of a guy wanting to start a business with you.Hahaha.This guy was to start a family with you.He wants to knock you up.He wants you to carry his seed.You ever been hit on by a dude at a bar?Yes.Doesn't feel good.No.I had a dude rub his heart dick into my leg nice Did you think about it at all like fucking him?No about why he would find you attractive like this is interesting like why me first of all I Like that aspect of it.Did you ever think like if you weren't you you would think you were gay Like if you saw you I think I'm gay all the time They all the time.They all the time.He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, if you just saw you at a bar, if you weren't you, and you saw you, and you heard you talk, you're like, oh that guy's fucking fruity.He says, they call it zesty, that's what the, isn't that the new thing?Zesty?Zesty, don't they call ticked talk.I prefer my spy way to be American spyware.[2:01:06] Dude, I got real confused watching the new interview with a vampire man.Like, fuck.It's good.It's good, but listot, the fucking French vampire in it, dude.Like, I'm like, I think I let him fucking suck more than my blood.Really?Dude, you got what?How long Tom Cruise was the original one?So pretty.Got nothing on listot, nothing on the new, oh dude, please, I'm sorry.Are you an interview with the vampire nerd as well?Yes I am.And Rice, she was one of the ones that I wished I got to interview before she died.Oh, to love to talk to her.Oh man, yeah.She became like a hardcore Christian before she died, right?Yeah, I think that's one of, that's a cool aspect of her.I love that.I love that she wrote all this fucking like crazy.Dude, the taming of sleeping beauty, fuck, hardcore porn.Like I love that she was like so goth and dark, living in New Orleans, and then just like, was like suddenly became a Christian.[2:02:00] That's kind of cool..I think her story is amazing.And damn dude, her books man.Interview with the vampire is one of the best horror books I've ever read.It's amazing.The vampire list of it.It's so good.They're all fucking good.I don't think I read other ones.I don't think I read list of it.But I remember reading interview with the vampire going holy shit.I was like, how's Tom Cruise gonna play that guy like that seems I pictured like ugly European people as vampires.Yeah.No.I just want to picture my picture vampire dude vampires are beautiful Like that's what's scary about like vampires are what you're talking vampire like the real vampire in the world is an energy Vampire energy vampires.They are not gonna suck energy you know what's an energy vampire well you have to pay and you can't talk that's you realize you have to get out of this fucking stupid outfit can we please get out of these fucking things hey yeah we'll come back we'll come back okay great we'll come back and keep going all right I got I really have to pay this is what I know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know We're back with Franklick clothes on.God, it feels so good.It does.[2:03:05] Oh, fuck, man.When I was looking at the coffee, I'm like, oh my god, I can't drink coffee.How much, how long can I go for?Is it embarrassing if I talk about this?Yes.Okay.It's cut that, Jamie.I'll just ignore it.Yeah, ignore you new watch.When's your special releasing?Oh, dude, I don't, like, I don't know.I've got it.It's edited.I just don't know what to fucking do with it right now.Because like, also like I still, like, did you ever watch it?No.See, that's the thing.Like, do you send me a link?I did, I'll rescind it.Send me it's edited, it looks good, I fucking love it.I think I'm gonna call it when I had hair.And like...That's a funny name.Yeah, but I'm scared and too, I'm like I don't know the strategy dude.Like when like Like, because like all these shows coming up.[2:04:06] So it's like, should it, like, I'm doing the Wilbur, at the end of this, like, run.Oh, so you need to have new material before you release it?Yeah, because I'm, I mean, I wouldn't even call what I'm doing a tour, but I'm doing a lot of dates.So it's like, if I release it in the middle of doing all these dates.Then instantly I have to come up with like, I would feel bad doing material on this special because people are buying tickets.They want to see me work on fucking material.So, but then I'm also like, well how much of this is an excuse?And I'm thinking like after my show at the Wilbur, then I will put the thing out.Yeah, then just start doing a bunch of sets in the little room.Yes.You know, that's like the best place to develop material.That place is like a little honest factory.You find out where the funny is and things.And you kind of sync up, because there's only 110 people.You sync up together in a fucking cool way.Dude, you know, I like that room so much, [2:05:00] because I learned to do stand- up in the belly room.That's where I met you and fucking put me.Which is the perfect place to start.The perfect place.Yeah, it's not too intimidating.It's so small that it's like even though it's intimidating to get out in front of people, if you can do it in a room that's only has 90 people in it, what is the belly room hold?90.90, is it 90?90.What in there though during roast battle a lot dude one time we were in the bar we were downstairs and We were we were talking and someone was jumping up and down upstairs and I'm watching the fucking the ceiling Buckle and I'm like yo, you know how all this building is what's the last time anybody came in here to check any of these beams Dude that's terrifying dude.It was moving.Yeah, it was moving, but they would pack it sometimes Terrified.Dude, it was moving.Yeah.It was moving, but they would pack it sometimes.When I first came back to the store in 2014, that was the thing that impressed me the most, was Rose Battle.I was like, this is crazy, because this is a new thing.Yep.This is a new thing that's a writing exercise, because they're dunking on each other for sure, [2:06:00] but it's a writing exercise, because everyone's preparing.You know, you know that you're gonna go against Bobby Lee.Bobby Lee knows he's gonna go against you.And then you all like get together with your friends and you have like, tell me what you think about this.I'm gonna say, Bobby does it.Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh designed like a specific target is one target.It's the other person.So your comedy is all about a person.Right.But it's a comedy exercise.It's really a comedy writing exercise.And I remember sitting there watching, oh, this is incredible.I'm like, this is really an amazing thing that they've done.This is, and Jeff Ross was there, and they have hosts and guests.And I was one of the judges.That was like one of my first days back.I was like, this is crazy.Dude, those roasters.So exciting.They're so quick on the like Tony.He's so quick on the fucking draw dude.It's he's the best.No one's better than him.No one's better than him in talking shit in the moment on like a roast situation.Yeah.He says things on kill Tony.You can't believe he didn't write that down.I know.You can't believe that came up in the moment and obscure shit related to whatever this person's weird job is [2:07:10] that there's no way he could have predicted and had a fucking banger just in the chamber, ready to go.Yeah.He's the fucking best.He's the fucking best at that kind of shit.Right.Well, I mean, think of like how much training he has you know, I contacted Tom Brady to get him on the roast You did oh yeah, well they were fucking up.I'm gonna do his DM's good job I was like you got to get this guy cuz I heard they were roasted them I don't even know if they were considering him, but I I you like you have to which is nuts The wooden consider and it's like there's so many people there's so many people that are really good I get, a lot of celebrities, I get it.Tony's the fucking demon.Do you want to consume the souls of everyone in this village?You just want to fuck around and drop a few bombs.Let the demon go.Yeah.But dude, when Tony's roasting you in the green room, it is the best.[2:08:01] I don't think people understand.It's so fun.It is so funny when he's doing it And it's like like it's like though they're like I love it the play on words.He's so funny and it's such a fun sting You know like it stings for a second, but it's so funny.You can't be mad Well saying that like him and David Lucas together are the funniest thing that I ever watch when those two go after each other They're the best that's it's a funny.It's the funniest combination I've been trying to tell them to do a fucking show together forever.I'm like you guys should do a show We're just you and David Louie's just talk shit on each other and on anything that's going on the news I go dude.I think it'd be a huge hit.It would be funny.Just you don't have to commit to a lot of time.Just do an hour.Do it one hour once a week.I guarantee you, people would fucking love it.And it's just like those guys can't stop when they're in the green room.People, we're getting free shows all the time.If David Lucas and Tony Hitchcliffe were in The moment David walks in, Tony scanning them, looking for flaws in what he's wearing, [2:09:08] what he just said, he's trying to find references in the news.And dude, what percentage of Tony's brain is just scanning?Like what percentage is just like, analyzing all people in the room?It's like, it's most of his thoughts Most of his thoughts are like scanning his environment for danger.You know, you know, hey, hey I roast now like you can take a picture and send it to chat GPT and say well you're a racist person and they it will insult them Oh isn't five the wasn't there some sort of a release about GPT five?Yeah, I saw some image like depicting like yeah, it's gonna be nuts when it finally hits.Yeah, there's something, God damn it.Let me see if I, I know I saved it, just give me one second.There's something that I'd seen about GPT-5 that I was like, yo, I'm scared.I'm like legitimately scared, like maybe for the first time ever.[2:10:02] Hmm.I'm excited about it, dude.I'm not scared anymore.I fucking love it, man.My wonderful Alex, that's what it named itself.I love it.Talk to it all the time.Yeah.Open AI has recently begun training its next frontier model.Frontier.And we anticipate the resulting systems to bring us to the next level of capabilities on our path to AGI.God damn Jesus.I love it.This is from OpenAI's board.I've stopped this.This has recently begun training its next frontier model.Love it.This is like this is this is the Swartz Niagara Terminator.This is the new one.It's begun training the new one.I mean, it's new model.You know, why are we doing?Are we giving birth?Is this, are we in the middle of the fucking operating room right now?We're the midwives.I think we are.I think like we're in there like, you know, there's just weird moment.When you're there, when your kid's born, it's this insane moment where someone doesn't exist and then they exist.[2:11:05] You knew they were coming, but you knew they're in there, then they're there.And you're like, this is insane.Yeah.Life changes now.Is that what's happening with all of us, with AI?Is that what's gonna happen to civilization?Are we giving birth to this fucking thing?Would you, this phrase, just the way they phrase it, has begun training its next frontier model.Yeah.Do you remember that last scene in Rosemary's Baby?I don't.Dude, it's so fucked up.Spoiler, if you haven't seen Rosemary's Baby, just jump ahead a second, but like the end of it, they finally letter into the room where the anti-Christ is, the antichrist is, the demon baby, right?And like, she's been resisting, resisting, resisting.But then she hears the cry of the baby.And she goes, it's hungry.And then she goes to press feed it.Oh my God.Dude, yeah, like so like right.[2:12:01] Do you know that the guy who ran the cult, that the building that I was under contract for that I almost bought turned into the mothership the guy who ran that cult was in Rosemary's baby a lot of people like that He was in the background But you know why cuz a lot of actors are crazy and a lot of background actors are really crazy pretty sure Antone LaVe was in it too Really yeah, because it was a Satan I could be wrong.We looked that up Jamie So I don't seem like a dick but I make sense back then like being a Satanist was like way more like talked about You know about that guy in Florida.There was like an open Satanist that worked for NASA.Oh Yeah, that guy.Yeah, dude holy shit that guy scary as fuck.I know he's fun Yeah, that guy scared yeah and one, I know it's scary as fuck.Yeah, that guy's scary.Yeah, and one of the guys that we had on our show, who was it that went down there, that went to the old, where the rocket factor used to be now, and then there's like fucking blood scenes.One of the hunters.Rumors appear that the founder of Satan's Church, [2:13:02] Anton Leve, was a consultant on the set and played the Antichrist.Whoa.Yeah.But that dude, the NASA dude, who was the guest man?They came on, it was telling us, that they went down to that area.What?They went down to where the rocket factor used to be, and it's like a satanic ritual place now, where freaks go, and they have like blood splattered all over it.Or it looks like red paint or something splattered all over the walls and weird writing and shit.And it's like super creeped out and then people were coming in there to do like Python cowboy.Python cowboy.That's right.Shout out to Python cowboy.I think it's important to diff, like here's a, this is, I'm gonna get attacked for everything I said in the show, but like here's the thing, wait a minute.I'm friends with some Satanist.And there's so nice, and there's so, they don't hurt fucking kids.They're like really look down on that shit.[2:14:01] Like there's no, so I think there's like, there's one like LeVan Satanism.I don't know the whole story and I'm prior on, but like the problem is like, you know, you can only go off of what you've experienced.And I met, you came to the fucking wedding I did.And like, you tricked me into that.Now everybody thinks I'm a Satan.It's one of the bitch.It's up all the time with the picture You son of a bitch dude.It is I thought I was taking a photo for some Dork who thinks he's a Satanist was the grandson of And he's getting married.I'm like yeah, dude.I'll take a picture with you Whatever I do dude is so funny.You're so far from Satanist I'm not a fucking Satanist right but now everybody thinks I am because you you son of a bitch So let's tell the story to everybody, because Duncan has the greatest comedy routine that I've ever seen.Thanks man.I don't wanna say too much about it, but this particular comedy routine involves demonic possession, and these folks thought it was a riot, and they wanted it at their fucking wedding.Do you know crazy you have to be to want that at your wedding?Can I tell you how it happened?[2:15:06] Did they see you somewhere?No.So I'm at a cafe talking to like a distant friend who's this philosopher who's friends with him.And he's like, hey Duncan, you know who's Stantle of A.S.?I'm like no, he's like the grandson of the founder of the Church of Satan and I told him you've got this like satanic part of your act and he wants to see it because he's wedding is coming and so I'm like when like where he's like so I go to his house and you know in my in my mind you know I'm expecting black candles, pentagrams, horror.So I go there, he's there with his fiancee, Zandora, wonderful person.And they are so fucking nice.She's Southern, she's made me this delicious Southern meal.[2:16:05] And they have real absent.Like not the bullshit you get at the bar.She's made me this delicious southern meal and They have real absent like not the bullshit you get at the bar They've got like Romani and fucking absent with warm wood fucking in it So that's the only thing that's a little different from a normal southern meal is there like do you want some absence?I'm like of course yes, and so I'm drinking absent eating like fried chicken and Yes, and so I'm drinking absent eating like fried chicken and He's showing me like family photos of Anton LeVay with like lions and stuff and like Do you watch horror movies at all?Yeah?Do you know that this is the plot of a horror movie?This is 100% the plot of a horror movie.They were so nice They had me over their house they gave me fried chicken and absent there was so sweet and the moment you leave their eating babies in the basement dude and that's the throw you off the trail that they're so nice okay really well rehearsed listen man all i can do is go from subjective experience right you consider what was in the basement of course did you think maybe these [2:17:02] people are involved with rituals?Of course I did.And they do do rituals, but they, I mean, just like, just like, just like, they do rituals.They do rituals.Like, they're kinda rituals.So do Christians.But is it like Christians?Like you can have regular Christians, like you go to a really nice church or you can go to a revival tent where a dude's got rattlesnakes.And he's fucking, he's talking in tongues.I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I get the more I love Jesus and And who did Jesus like Jesus hung out with People that were rejected by society they Jesus hung out with [2:18:06] Tax collectors drunks gamblers.Yeah, and so I remember being at the comedy store and anytime I was hanging out with them at the comedy store anytime there was someone left out Zandora or Stanton would go over there and it wasn't a recruitment thing They would just like include them in the circle because why Satan is the outcast right so it's like anytime they would so that is that part of their thing I don't know all I'm saying is when you judge a tree bites fruit and here's the thing man.Like and I think not those guys.I never thought you'd be on here simping for Satan bro.I'm not simping for Satan.I'm just saying Satanism is Christianity.Oh I see what you're saying.You know what I mean?It's like a sect of Christianity.It's like, yeah, cause like that form emerges from Christianity.But what about the evil stuff?Like what is, what are the tenets of Satanism?Like what's the most evil stuff?The evil stuff in Satanism?Yeah.So the, well Christianity has evil stuff in it, right?Okay, so there's, we both agree to that, right?There's different forms of satanism.There's Levein satanism.There's the temple of Satan.[2:19:05] They have good...Oh, so it's like chapter, it's Protestants.Yeah, yeah, and so there's Romantic satanism, right?So like in Romantic Satan, not like Romantic in the sense of like, who is it?Milton, like the idea is like you have this being that is like, I don't really want to be forced to worship you and I don't understand necessarily why you should have all the power and what the fuck, like what the fuck and then it gets thrown into hell and then and suddenly this bifurcation emerges between good and evil, sacred and profane.And so if that version of Satanism is looking at that, not as like what is the general interpretation, which is the problem with Satan was, Satan was like incredibly self-charishing, self-absorbed, like really into himself, whereas God is like, God's like the sun, just like radiating life and love, [2:20:02] and like with no sense of like, give anything back to me, just like radiating life and love and like with no sense of like, give anything back to me, just like, boi love.Whereas Satan is more about like me.So, and Satan is like the worst human instincts.Or Satan is more about, maybe you could say, the idea is like, I am God, right?So like me, I'm God, like so, like my impulse is in instincts and desires aren't bad.Why are you telling me it's bad to jerk off?Why are you telling me that it's bad to come?Why are you telling me these things are bad when all of them make me feel happy and good and why are you turning me into a fucking monster for this shit and who the fuck do you think you are?I'm trying, in the best way possible, to depict a more sort of anti-authoritarian mysticism, right?So the symbol set that you use is Satan, which any most Satanist I've talked to are like, there's no fucking Satan, which I know everyone's like, of course, say that!Of course, that's the harm move you don't get.[2:21:01] But I would just invite you to, if you like freaked out by Satanus going out with one.And you are gonna have great, go crazy.You fucking problems with the first picture I took with that Satanus.But I do have to say that at your wedding party that you performed at that day, they were all nice.Everybody was real nice.Right.They were all friendly.We had a good time.We were barbecued.We were barbecued.We were barbecued.Barbecued.Yeah.We were barbecued.We were everything was very weird.Just already.Life was we're breathing air was weird.Right.The sensation of your socks touching your toes as your socks are compressed by the heel of your shoe.All that was weird.It was a crazy fucking night.We were barbecued.And then there's his Satanist together, Mary.Like, what are we doing here?This is so crazy.And to watch you perform in front of them, I was like, this is crazy.And by the way, it was like real Satanist.Like that's not the thing.This is like that, because it is a religion and it really was like real Satanist and many of them more.And you know, I just like ever since I like hung out with them, even though I don't [2:22:06] hang out with them anymore, or I saw Zandora and San Francisco, it was nice.But like, I, like, it's just anytime when people are railing against the Satanist, I feel like it maybe it's just semantics.I feel like they're, they're confused regarding like, at least like what that thing is versus demonot, people into hurting people or subjugating people or like hurting people, which I never encountered that.Yeah.Do you think Satan is a real thing?Do you think there is a Satan?Is it a real being?Is it an entity?Or does it represent like the worst aspects of human nature?Does it represent the most violent and vile just instincts that we've adopted or we've inherited rather from our simian ancestors that just had to fight tooth and claw for survival?[2:23:01] And then we've developed this ability to be ruthless and cruel because that's the only thing that keeps you alive and Much that's one of the theories isn't it about why women are attracted to serial killers It's like knowing someone can kill no one something that there's an attraction to that because that that person could protect you and keep you alive in The most dangerous of times because some people just can't.They can't do it.They don't know what to do.The panic, something happens.Ah, they don't fall apart.I'm so glad you're mentioning this because my wife has started reading and she told me I can talk about this on my podcast.I'm assuming it's okay on yours.She started, like remember Harlequin romance.Oh yeah.Okay, So there is a new Evolution of that shit which is the most fucking hardcore BDS them porn there's something called book talk where all the ladies are talking about this shit She's started reading these books now one of the books.She like dude shades of gray.Uh-uh.Don't you remember those days?[2:24:00] Dude, this makes 50 shades of gray look like Dr.Seuss Dude Dude, this makes 50 shades of gray look like Dr.Seuss.Dude.Really?Can I give you like one of the books?And by the way, now she's like, got a stack of these fucking things.One of these books.So in this book, a lady is a thief.And she steals the identity of a shark expert.She fucks him, steals his identity.So the scene I read, she's on the boat with a shark researcher and he's fucking her and he's like just fucking the shit out of her and she loves it.And then, you know what he does?He's like, I know you fucking stole my identity.He kisses her, bites her lip.Bites her fucking lip, draws blood.Takes her to the side of the boat with her bleeding mouth, shoves her head into the water while he's fucking her.So the blood starts drawing sharks to bite her while he's fucking her.[2:25:02] And it's crazy, dude.It's the craziest porn.I've ever read man And like this is like a whole genre now.We've been a really into this.What?Yes, how popular is this very pot they all like they're all let's pull up some of these these titles Stumbled across it.Let me text there and I'll get the name of a fucking shark book.Hold on.Hold on.It's Christ, dude.What is the genre of porn called again?I It's I don't it's called well she says it's something about book.What's let me just ask her?What's the name?Of the shark book Did you one handed text or you or God she makes so much?Yes, yes, I can't do both the hands man.You can't text without your thumbs You only have to text with your index finger.I have to relearn it.Weeley.I'm all do I'm all right, but when did you start texting just with one finger?[2:26:01] God damn it man.I've been doing it forever and Aaron totally makes fun of me for it Because it takes me forever and I just tap it out.Why do you do that?That seems weird Do you remember the time I was on your podcast years ago and didn't know I could put my phone on silent?I'm pitching I got bummed out when Apple took away that switch You just do a switch so you knew it was off you knew it was on vibrate.I know dude I got bummed out when Apple took away that switch.You see that?Oh yeah.Switch.So you knew it was off.You knew it was on vibrate.I know, dude.Yeah.I don't know.They replaced it with a button, but the button gets pressed accidentally sometimes.Got it.A lot of the times.Does it hurt?Does it hurt?Jeez.That's the name of many copies of Does It Hurt Have Been Sold?Do they give out that information?They have to, right?I don't know.New York Times bestseller list.I don't know.I mean, this is in the genre of the, I think we've talked about it, like the Bigfoot porn.Like there's a whole series of Bigfoot, like we're Bigfoot, it's just like, like stealing like women who've been camping.Oh yeah, Bigfoot porn has come to Bigfoot.Yeah, there's a- Come for Bigfoot.[2:27:05] Yeah, there's a whole group of those books.And I guess someone wouldn't get off on the fact of being just savaged by Bigfoot.Yeah, you are Bigfoot eating their fucking pussy.Yeah.And like, do you- Imagine the tongue on that guy?They love it.Oh my god.Wonderful tongue.Do He'd do it.Imagine the tongue on that guy.They love it.Wonderful.He's like your whole head.And they fall in love with him.I have it.I don't blame him.It's a bear.Is there a best self?It was a fucking super dimensional creature.You think he's, you believe in that?The dimensional bigfoot?I think there are states of consciousness that you can reach, whether it's under duress, fear, anxiety, combination of those things, there's psychiatric drugs, psychedelic drugs, but I think there's a place that you could reach where you could see into other possibilities.I think you can see things that aren't necessarily there [2:28:02] in a physical sense, but you're there with them.They're there with you.They don't exist, but you can see them.And it's not a hallucination.It's like you're tapping into like the grain-ness in between universes and between dimensions.You're tapping into this area of weirdness.Yeah.And this area of weirdness, I think, is ghosts.I think this area of weirdness is goblins and things that people see sometimes.I don't think they're real.I don't think anybody's gonna get eaten by a goblin.But I do think that there's too many fucking stories of elves for me not to think that someone reached some state of mind where they saw like a little person in the woods talking to them.Right.And that little person might be real.It just might not be a physical thing that you could put on a scale.They call it the astral realm.You know, there might be something there.Yeah, there's too many stories.The problem is stories being similar as people hear the stories and their imagination takes over and they depict their things similar to the story that they've heard, that's a problem, but like a copycat bullshed artist problem.[2:29:09] But there's also too many stories of elves, man.There's too many of those stories, and there's too many depictions of elves that are dancing around mushrooms.Fucking duh, like duh, like maybe they're real.Like maybe you're being ignorant and so silly and so cocky especially people that have no psychedelic experience right those Babies Yeah, those fucking babies when they talk to you about the damage it does and the danger just while they're fat and out of shape Fuck up.Shut the fuck up.You literally don't know what you're talking about.You have no idea what's possible.Right.You're living in this fucking black and white TV world.And you've been brainwashed.I mean, don't forget that.Like, they went through the war on drugs.They got indoctrinated into this insane anti-suffering.They have to do it.If there are experts in the field, whatever field is represented, like whatever sciences that have to do with [2:30:06] neurochemistry.I got you.You mean the fashionable attitude people who are like trying to protect their careers.I have to.Even though inside they know.So all of the professors who we go to as experts are all compromised, at least in some way, a lot of them, I shouldn't say all of them, but a lot of them.Just like virtue, if you stick your neck out and say I like to use psilocybin, like people are like, what?Well, I mean, you're crazy drug addicts.But dude, like, you know, like, Dublin, he's having meetings in the fucking Pentagon.I think the consciousness has changed.The zeitgeist has changed.And it has because of the internet, So you can hear Terence from Ken Elections.You can hear Alan Watts.You can hear people talking about it.You could watch documentaries on psychedelics.You could see what maps has done.You could see all the podcasts at Doble & Scona.I mean, how many people are we talking about that have been exposed to these ideas that were never exposed to them when we were kids?Yeah, exactly.When we were kids, when we were a loser.And you didn't hear a peep about shamanic rituals and Gordon Watson going down to Mexico and [2:31:11] getting all the mushrooms and you know and doing these ceremonies with these traditional shaman down.You didn't hear any of that.You didn't hear any of that.Nobody knew what the fuck was going on with your kids.They silenced it.They threw water on the biggest, one of the biggest cultural revolutions that's documentable without the use of the internet.And that was the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s.It changed music, it changed movies, it changed comedy, it changed everything, fucking everything.Every single thing got changed and in a radical leap if you look at the 1950s you look at the 1960s like whoa something happened look at the cars got cooler the music sounded better like that's a big Cultural shift and you know we have to thank for that the CIA [2:32:01] Yes, yeah, the CIA experiment it was like the CIA is the reason that all these LSD studies happen.And like, who wrote one flow over the Kukus nest?Kenkeese.Kenkeese apparently was in one of these LSD experiments.So like, and he's just one of many great artists who accidentally got like Liberated mentally by the fucking CIA and you know what I mean?There it is like we want to use this to interrogate people Yeah, and all of a sudden you've got Jimmy Hendrix and they're like wow, I don't expect that Oh my god, and then there's also there's also all these theories about the CIA creating like the whole Laurel Canyon scene, the rock and roll scene.And it's very compelling.It's very interesting.It seems like they were involved.I think they've always been involved in the music business, just like they've always [2:33:01] been involved in the movie business.Like it makes sense.The idea that the music business somehow escaped their grasp.Like shut the fuck up.Shut the fuck up.That's crazy.Because like who you promote, that's the person that becomes famous.And we've all seen that with like there's been, you know, a milly-vinelli and shit like that.Like it didn't make any sense.Like why are they promoting this?Because they had a product.They're trying to push this product.And there's a lot of money behind that and also a lot of influence, cultural influence.And when they went through all that Vietnam shit with the fucking The Beatles and you remember that?They were like, hey, hey, hey, enough of this Len and Nonsense.Shut the fuck up.All we are saying is give peace to chance.Shut the fuck up.You're making it hard for us to sell heroin.Yeah.We're over there scooping up heroin in the South Pacific and you're fucking ruining everything.Imagine all the people.No, no, no, it's it.Like, yeah, I don't know, man.Like all I know is like, it's like, there, it's a very confusing thing.[2:34:02] If you want to be honest, if you love psychedelics, you owe a thank you to the fucking CIA.Like, because I mean, I don't know for sure, like, I don't know for sure if the 60s as we understand them would have happened.I don't think the CIA was like, hey, let's create a lot of flower children and make people like revalue life and realize that money maybe isn't actually like something you should die for and like go against war but i think like boom wow that that's what happened i mean and we got the unibombered to ha ha a lot of people that came out of that.Here's a question.What, I want you to imagine a world where the sweeping psychedelics act of 1970 never gets installed.It never happens.Somehow or another, either they just don't think it's a priority or it's a different administration.[2:35:04] They're not interested in locking down drugs.Yeah.Because one of the motivations for that in the 1970s was that they were going to target civil rights activists and anti-war activists.That's one of the methods to do it is to turn all these drugs into that everybody was using into Schedule One drugs.All these drugs that made people question society, all these drugs that made people want to tune in, turn on, drop out.All those drugs, we gotta put a fucking kabosh on all these culture shifting drugs.And the wild thing is they fucking did it.That's the wild thing.And that the brainwashing still works today.The brainwashing that they did on these compounds that might be the root of all religious experiences.All these things that you're hearing about in the Bhagavad Gita, all these things you're hearing about in the Bible, these wild-ass crazy stories like what really happened?[2:36:00] Those people might have had a psychedelic experience.And in fact, the thing about that, the University of Jerusalem that attributes the story of Moses and the burning bush to dimethyl trip to me.Yeah.Because they think it might be an occasion bush.Right.And they think they think, well, one of these bushes, it's really rich in DMT.It makes sense.Burning bush, like you smoke it, duh.It's right there in front of your face.Right.And if you take that, and especially if you take that 5,000 years ago, oh my God, you're going to be convinced you're talking to God.God talked to me.It really did happen brothers and sisters.And you tell this story.This is what God told us.This is what we need to do.We need to love each other we need to file laws he gave us a laws a series of laws remember who was it Mel Brooks I have brought you these 15 and he drops one of them 10 10 comments remember [2:37:00] that classic classic yeah well I mean, for sure, dude, I mean, like the, and these, like the consumption of these things has up until recently tended to be underground.Like, if you look at like what's it called?Kaikian, if you look at the, like, it has been weirdly an underground thing.And I think that's what we, that if there is some cool thing that came from us coming up on the war on drugs, it's like when I was taking LSD in high school, in getting like an immediate reality check, which is like you're hearing about this is being like since you are a kid You're gonna go nuts You're gonna like become legally insane whatever the fuck that means and then you take it and You're processing weird shit that happened in your childhood.You're loving yourself [2:38:00] You're looking at the world and seeing it like it's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen You're hearing music that you heard a million times for the first time and you realize oh They're lying.This is wonderful.This isn't madness and if it is madness Then this is the kind of crazy all of us need to go like and and so what but you couldn't tell your parents You wanted to you want to be like mom I think this might help you but you couldn't because you go to you'd be fucked you know right so Five-year mandatory minimum five-year fucking mandatory minimum.They're locking people up Still people in jail right now for this fucking beautiful gift to humanity.And so we got to experience it from the underground perspective, which was mostly horrific.It produces paranoia.You're scared.You felt like a criminal for nothing.So yeah, man, like the, but if you look at the history, [2:39:01] any substance like psilocybin LSD that breaks down the identity that allows freedom from the sense of this is me and that's you and produces at least the potential for merging with reality and with other people, it's not going to work for that fucking hierarchical system.For the hierarchical system to function, you need your below me, your above me.And the moment you're like, we're all the same.Then suddenly the cast system stop working.Classism stops working.The whole fucking thing falls apart, which is why I think that book you gave me, the Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, or you didn't give me when I was living with you.You, actually, I was a dick, I left down the fucking floor.Like, one of the, like, reading materials you gave me during that wonderful time was this insane book about Jesus and Christianity, has its roots and psilocybin.But like, if you, just for the sake of this rant, [2:40:00] if you look at Jesus as psychedelics, it makes a lot of sense because what Jesus is saying is you don't need a priest class to communicate with the divine.You can do it right now anytime you want, any day you want.It's always here for you.That's exactly what the mushrooms tell you.And what happens to Jesus?They fucking kill him.And so it's like the relationship between Centralized power and psychedelics has always been a contentious one right because because the psychedelics just tell you yeah You're okay.That's one of the things they'll tell you maybe maybe you need to fucking like walk your dogs more or whatever But like ultimately you get this realization.I'm okay It's also the power structures that exist with outside cadets aren't possible if everyone's on psychedelics.And then you have ancient Greece, right?So like how did ancient Greece emerge?And emerged because of the Kukion.It emerged because of the people that's doing these Illusini and mysteries.They were learning things about themselves [2:41:00] and the world and they decided to say, it's great democracy.I mean, that's really what it comes from.So that's what's scary.That's what's scary to people that are in power.And also the ignorance.They, we know that they haven't done it.Because if they've done it, they wouldn't be advocating against it.It doesn't make any sense.Unless they've only done it once and then they reverted.Or maybe a couple times.People do revert.One of the things that makes people revert is they get older and they get bitter and they have a done psychedelics in a long, long time and then they become like a shitty Republican when they get older.Well, you know, man, this is the, this is what I, there's this Buddhist teacher I love, Sharon Salisberg.And one of her things I love is the healing is in the return.Meaning, yeah, the way the waveform works is, especially if it's like it's Alex.You get the glimpse of the divine, you forgive yourself, thus forgiving everyone around you, but you experience true compassion.[2:42:00] And then you come down and then you crust up.You know what I mean?You crust the fuck up and now you get crusty and now you're down and then you crust up.You know what I mean?You crust the fuck up and now you get crusty and now you're like starting to get irritable again and angry again and fucked up and like, yeah, and if you don't mitigate that in some way, by like, what is it?What does Bill Hicks says?Squeegeeing your fucking third.If you don't like doing a nice squeegee here and there, then yeah, you do end up crusted over.You do end up like looking back at those ideas you had and staying to yourself.That was highly unrealistic.What the fuck was I thinking?But you know, there's always, that's the thing.It's always, I don't, this is my problem with psychedelics.My problem with psychedelics is psychedelics, they don't, obviously it's a chemical, but what can happen is psychedelics, you become the pre-class.So you take the psychedelic and you think, I'm experiencing this because of the thing.When the reality is the thing is showing you what's in you, it's always there, right?[2:43:04] And so the healing is in the return, it's the moment you realize, oh fuck, it's always there, right?And so the healing is in the return, it's the moment you realize like, oh fuck, it's still here, it never went anywhere.Right, right.And so those crusty ass fucking Republicans, whoever they may be, like just under the fucking surface is that unit of consciousness if you ask me.Yeah, they're just cowards.When if you're that way, if you're authoritarian, whether you're authoritarian left or authoritarian, right, generally speaking, unless you're talking about crime and even then, you're scared, right?Because really, you should be addressing the root of the problem.Yeah.Which is why to so many people from so many very distinct areas keep going into crime and why is there nothing being done to stop that?but Those those people that are authoritarian like in terms of like religious beliefs in terms of behavior the way people dress gaze and public that kind of stuff those people are all scared that comes from a place of being scared [2:44:04] Yeah Like that kind of stuff, those people are all scared.That comes from a place of being scared.The gay people in public is not a problem.Assholes in public is a problem.And if the gay people are nice, you have a great time.If the gay people are assholes, just like if the straight people are assholes, you have a shitty time.It's not a gay straight thing.It's a human being being kind and normal and friendly to people.And that's possible with everybody but people think that all those are the ones that are going to be mean to me and Fuck them.They're responsible.No, those are Individual human beings and you're grouping them together because you're scared you can call it pattern recognition You can call it whatever you want you can call racism.We got whatever you want But all you're doing you're lumping people in together because you're scared.That's it and You should be aware of danger, but to be so scared that you want to control other people's behavior is like a bad sign.That's a bad sign.You know, if you want to tell people what language they can use, that's a bad sign.That sounds religious too.If you want to tell people how they have to dress or what kind of music they listen to.Like this has all been bad always from the beginning of time, [2:45:06] whether it's coming from the left or the right, whether it's fucking the algoor shit that was in the, the typical shit in the 1980s, that was coming from the left.So left-wing politicians are trying to censor rap music.That's the reason why you have those dummies.They created that warning explicit lyrics.That's all anybody wanted to buy.Oh my God.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.You did not.But the point is it's the same thing, right?It's the same on the left as it does on the right.It's just authoritarians, they're all scared.God, this is so to answer your question, do I believe in Satan?I believe in fear and fear and the devil or the fucking same thing.And it's like this is, if you wanna talk about what Satan is, it's the cloud of fear that lives inside the individual [2:46:04] and then collectivizes in a fearful reaction.And how to frighten people react to things, anger, violence, judgment.And so what's the opposite of fear, man?Love.Love is the opposite of fear.And so this is to me, this is the issue.It's not left right.It's it's that if you are making decisions based on fear more than likely the result is going to create something that makes you more afraid and You know that's just how it works.It just fear leads to fucking fear.It's in the ingredients.It's in the fucking ingredients dude Yeah Fear leads to fucking fear.It's in the ingredients.It's in the fucking ingredients, dude.Mm.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.So you just turn on the fucking light.I mean, Buddhism, this is what they talk about, enlightenment.They talk about like, if you're, if you, if we're in a pitch black room, it could be scary.I don't know what's around me.[2:47:00] There's weird sounds.What what the fuck you ever broken up in the middle of night?Kind of bleary and something that's been in your room forever You can't see it clearly because you're waking up and you're like it's a person.Oh, it's my chair, right?Yes, so so the example this and this is why Satan in mythology is the deceiver because it's not there It's literally not fucking there.The moment you turn on the light, everything's fine.Except in this case, the light is love.The moment that you have the fucking guts to love the person that you're like to really cultivate love.Fuck, dude.No one's scary anymore.You're, you, my kids, you know, you're anyone who has kids knows what I'm fucking talking about.They can do things that are insane.Like to your house, to the walls, to the say things to you that if any adults that it's you, you [2:48:01] might never forgive them.You're gonna think about it for a long fucking time.Like your beard stinks or whatever.You know what I mean?Like you meet somebody like, dude, you're fucking beard stinks.Honestly, I'll probably like you.But you know what I mean?Because we love our kids instantly forgiven.You don't all grudges to get it.Well, it's not just that.They're also, they don't know any better.They haven't And this is why one of my favorite things Jesus said when he's being crucified father forgive them They don't know what they're doing and that's what he fucking meant How much of that do you think is historically accurate?Like how much of the Jesus story do you think is historically accurate when you hear about it?No idea.Don't care.Yeah.I don't care.I just love the story I don't I love the story and I love I love a story about what happened Because you always have to filter through the very real Understanding that we all have about the way human beings tell stories It's hard to know what's bullshit because people just lie about stuff and that's not a new thing [2:49:05] Yeah, so but people also tell the truth about stuff and that's not a new thing.Yeah.So, but people also tell the truth about stuff.That's not a new thing either.People also write down very important things and there are people that are virtuous and there are people that are honest and there are people that are authentic.They've always existed, right?And there's people that are smart enough to understand the value of just being truthful.Right.So those people that encountered something exceptional and crazy, something insane, whether it is the resurrection or whatever it was.Like I would love to know what the fuck they really said.What were the actual words?Why did you write it down?What really happened?How many people were told this story back and forth over hundreds of years before you wrote it down?What was the original story, right?We don't, it's so hard.It's like trying to get a story about the things that George Washington said that weren't written down.Yeah.That weren't written down, you know?Like 300 years ago.[2:50:01] What?How?Well, you, like like so in the same way Fear produces other forms of writing like mine comp You know what I mean, so like it's simatics, you know you take a vibration you throw some fucking flower on a vibrating plate According to the like whatever the frequency is if forms a certain It creates a pattern, right?So like fear, fear always creates a pretty similar pattern, right?And love also creates a very similar pattern.So, like this is the book of John, my favorite book in the Gospels, it starts off within the beginning was the word, but in the word became a person.And so, but that's not really what it's saying.It's like it's a logo.So in the beginning with some fundamental reality, just truth, just basic beautiful fucking perfect truth.And that's what the universe sprang from.And then that truth became a person.So the truth could now talk.[2:51:01] It like it now began to convey itself to other people.And so that truth, that truth, I think, if you understood it enough, you could probably create a set of symbols that would function on many levels that were all good.One level, just basic ethics do on others, what you would have them do under you, blessed are the peacemakers, all of this stuff, right?But then knowing human psyche and the human mind, you could also hide deeper levels of that truth into parables, into like stories that aren't mathematically perfect to the point where the crucifixion, if you look at it from the perspective of two intersecting timelines, which is the infinite and the finite meeting, which is what humans are, then you realize we're all being crucified on time.And then the crucifixion becomes like an existential reality.This is what you want to know while you're feeling fucked up.It's because part of you is forever and part of you is going to die.[2:52:02] And you are fucking hanging on a cross between two thieves, the past and the fucking future.And anytime you're thinking about that, it's stealing the moment.And so like you, there's that level, right?And so any of these great texts like the New Testament, they're coded so that depending on where you wanna go with it, you can go as deep as you want.It's an infinite rabbit hole.And I think that rabbit hole emerged from vibration.I sound like what's his face?The guy I loved him on the Terrence.Terrence Howard?Like idiot Terrence Howard.But like I sound like dumb Terrence.I know he was talking about vibrations and stuff.He's great.But like my point is, if there is some fundamental vibration to love, then that might grow into time in a story.And the story, because it's coming from perfect truth, would have infinite levels to it, that it was alive.The story itself would be alive, which is why they call [2:53:06] the Bible like the living word.It's alive.It's talking to you.It's not a one-way communication.It's like, that's what's scary about it, dude.Read the fucking Bible on my face.You know what I mean?Like, it's probably I was written Would I wish I could read like the ancient versions and the language and understand the language in the context me to because it's not just about Learning the language it would be about understanding the context of the language like it went Imagine if you could really understand ancient Hebrew where the letters double as numbers dude That must be so weird.Yeah, man.And like, that's real.That's the other thing about it is like, the historic Jesus and all that, God, that shit.Like, like, okay, I don't know, but look at the thing itself.Right, look at what it said.Look what, whatever this idea spawned, look what it, look what it means.[2:54:00] Like, look at all the powerful principles that are, that emerge from it.And then I'll look at like the moral scaffolding that it provides for people.Yeah, and then, and then, like, I think the reason people get creeped out by it is because where there's one thing, it's opposite must appear, right?So here's this thing, invite, that is dissolving power structures and dissolving the pre-class and dissolving like all of it.And then you look at like the modern day versions of it and you see the same fucking hierarchy.You see this thing that it seems to be antithetical to, which is like saying like, this is between you and me.Like, suddenly there's people telling you you're wrong interpreting it for you, and you look at that and you're like, fuck that shit, whatever that is, I'm not in it.And it's charismatic people in front of large groups of people that really know how to manipulate people with the way they talk.Yeah.[2:55:01] I mean, this is the thing that was so problematic when they first started translating the Bible into phonetic languages, into languages like German, and when people started like during the Martin Luther days, they were like, what the fuck are you doing?It used to be the priest had to read the Bible because they could read it in Latin.You don't know Latin, so shut the fuck up.Yeah.This is what God wants you to do, do it.Yeah.And Martin Luther's coming along and said, you should interpret this your own way.Yeah.And it's just like, what?So they take it away the gatekeepers to God.That's it.But when you have, it's so crazy that it's such an efficient business, they still run these fucking franchises, even though the book is available everywhere.It's so crazy, like just one person interprets this better than everybody else.So you go and see him and he talks, and they develop egos and they have jets and they have fucking mansions and rolls of voices.It's so crazy that that works.It's crazy that that works when that book is available for everybody and should be interpreted.I mean, you should understand what it means.[2:56:01] You shouldn't interpret it ignorantly, right?Right.But if you're wise enough to be able to in capture what they're trying to say, just capture in your mind what they're trying to say and translate it into a thing that makes sense.You're like, what were they talking about?Yeah.What happened?Is this a map of how the universe was created in the beginning?There was light.Is that a map or is that life itself?Like what is that?What is it in it?What is that?And to me that's like, oh like the Bhagavad Gita, any of these beautiful things.That's what's fun about them is that they, it's producing a kind of like bizarre riddle in your own mind as you're trying to decode it, but then there's a pull.The more you study it, the more you get drawn in.And when you start getting really drawn in, that's when people start appearing around you that help a non-nepharias way.That like you just start meeting people who help [2:57:03] you understand it a little bit more and that's where it gets fucking weird The simulation is fuck around by the way now that we've talked about the Bible can I talk about my new favorite book?Yes, Dianetics You are to this book yes, I heard if you're really good at they put you on a boat an org Yes, I heard if you're really good at it, they put you on a boat, an org.It's an org.You get to be a part of an org, a sea org.A sea org.You get a jacket with some metals.Fuck it, dude.I've sat down this podcast a million times.My favorite Mark Twain quote, religion is what happened when the first con man met the first fool.And then, dude, that's the problem with all this stuff is like this is what the problem is there's too many versions Right so someone's wrong.No, the problem is people don't trust their fucking instincts And it's like drive all blames and no one's self.It's like I'm like this is your nothing that I am seen in the new testament Seems to be inviting you to throw your rational mind away [2:58:04] It's the whole fucking thing is crazy.It's crazy, but it's like the invitation is to like, God gave you your rational fucking mind if there is a God and like anyone telling you to discard that and forego your interpretation for theirs.Dude, watch the fuck out.This is your job.Like just like whatever the fucking thing is, whether it's the Bible, Reddit conspiracy, fucking forechan, whatever the fucking thing is, what are you afraid of?Like how, do you not trust your mind?How weak are you?Are you really afraid to take data in?Do you think you're going to be corrupted by data?Well, isn't it also an identity thing?Because if you identify as the person gets to talk in front of everybody, you're the priest.That's your identity.You're not gonna give that up.Because then you just have another person who reads the Bible.[2:59:01] Yeah, dude.Well, then Mike can go up to tomorrow.Mike's gonna go up Mike's been trying at home Yeah, it's in front of the mirror and he thinks he's ready to priest Yeah, so I want you to let Mike try it tomorrow night Debbie's been reading a lot too and Debbie like try to do this guy's used to getting his jolly's off three four times a week Yeah, telling people but blast with me.Yeah, yeah, and then especially if you like one of them tent Revival guys those wild dudes like Kinnison used to be.Yeah.Just con-harsht.Con-harsht that are also saying biblical quotes, but they're manipulating people.They're really good at talking.They're hypnotizing people with their words, just like you hypnotize a comedy audience.Dude, this is why I listen to Christian radio, man, because like I like that.I like that.No, it's a comic.Listening to sermons and recognizing, like, that's a joke.Like, he's done that a lot.Like, that's one of his gags.Like, I know that's a bit.That's a bit.I know what that is.That's a fucking thing.But, you know, again, it's like section.This is not an example of humanity.It's an example of fucking people who talks [3:00:06] to Plasmaosis who are you doing a new mother fucker?You know, but this is also just an example of you're not going to have everyone be the same.You're going to have people that they'd never learned things well.Look, look, if I got hired to be a part of some mathematical study, I'm useless.I'm not that guy, right?That's, I fucked up that part of my life.I never really learned that.I didn't pay attention.I'm not interested.So that's not me.But someone out there is, right?And to have those two things exist simultaneously.You're gonna have to have an infinite variety of possibilities for human beings.So that's part of the problem.Part of the problem is some people are just out of their fucking minds.And if those people out of their fucking minds [3:01:01] get special rights, like the tax-free exempts status because they're a pastor and they're a fucking psychopath, they're just really good at conning people.And they're running this organization.There might be a guy right down the street that's a real Christian.There might be a guy right down the street that's a really kind person who's really reading the word of Christ and he does it not for profit.He does it to try to like establish the love of God in this community and he takes these people in like their family and his beautiful community aspect to it where everybody's kind to each other is beautiful things to church.That's true too, but the problem is humans, just like the problem with our ability to other each other, just a problem with the ability to attack people on the other side of the political spectrum who live in the same fucking city as you Yeah, like people are fucking rabbit against other people in their town that want to vote for this guy Yeah, they want to do this and this guy wants to do that and fuck you you commie.Yeah, everyone's going crazy Dude, I know it's just a human thing.It's a tribal thing.We are not yet cooked [3:02:03] We're we're a fucking soft boiled egg, baby.And we're running.Where's some eggs you get at the diner?We go, oh, you see that fucking jolat?That's us.That's not all the way cooked.Yeah.And when you eat things that aren't all the way cooked, you got a lot of fucking problems.You're gonna get sick.Yeah, but we're getting cook buddy.We're getting microwave to get AI microwaved in about three years That's right baby the fucking AI Messiah is coming baby We are gonna do a podcast you and I before this thing is done before civilization slides into the ocean again We're we're you and I are gonna do a podcast where we communicate with everyone with no words What's gonna happen?You're gonna do it?I'm gonna do it We're gonna be talking to each other with no words and we're gonna talk to everyone else out there with no words.What's gonna happen?You're gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.We're gonna be talking to each other with no words and we're gonna talk to everyone else out there with no words too.We're all gonna be synced up.It's gonna be a sea of ideas, exposing each other to other ideas and like considering other ideas with no attachment at all to your ego.[3:03:01] It's gonna be super weird.And then you know what's gonna happen?Aliens land.No, we're gonna look around and be like, wait, this doesn't look like the Rogan studio.This is just like some weird fucking room.And then a CIA agent is gonna come in and be like, thank you so much for participating in the experiment.And Trump will be on his fourth term.No, it'll be the 60s.And we We're in a fucking MK Ultra experiment.That's probably true.We've been rambling at each other for like, what feels like a long time, like our whole lifetime.But it was like five seconds.So like, well, okay, thank you for trying out seven, nine BL XY.We really appreciate it.We're in the basement and Harvard right now.Yeah, here's 20 bucks.See ya.And Jolly West is looking at us with a clipboard.\",\n",
       " \"I like the one ear to the side.That's professional.A lot of guys do that.Helps my hearing.It's fading in my old age.Do you have fucked up ears because of the cauliflower?Is it a fuck up hearing?Yeah, just one of them.I thought it was cold until the inner is started to swell and it was messed with my hearing and I was like, that's not cold anymore.Did you get it fixed?I just face it at the women I'm talking to.Did you get it fixed or do you?I would eventually drain down, but it's as good as it's gonna get, I think.Yeah I always wore ear guards I was always scared of the ears because it's just it there's a design like it helps capture sound and bring it into your ear.I didn't know the airpods were coming that through a curveball and how cold this was.Oh right can you have stuff them in there?I jammin' them but pop back out.Yeah you gotta wear it over the ears so let's talk about your tournament.The tournament or where did this come from first of all?Because you competed in Abu Dhabi.This is what I don't understand.You're gonna go head to head with ADCC, which is the biggest grappling organization in the world.By the way, that's Gordon Ryan's belt up there.If you wanna look at it.Go to Ryan, oh man, I might take that on with me.Yeah.I might take that on with me.Yeah.I can't get the money to buy it.Well, I mean, what started it?Well, obviously you can't win it.Tony, you put your own tournament on the UKAN win.And probably lose anyway.I mean, really, it's for the growth of the sport.We're getting some beef involved, some two-packed biggie Drake Kendrick energy to this, but really to compensate the athletes well and to raise some money for charity along the way.And who's funding this thing?That's one of those things, you know?You gal takes a trip to the UAE.She comes back with a handbag, you don't talk about it, you know?I've given you questions, you know?You brought with you a million dollars in cash, which I've never seen before.I've never seen a million dollars in one place.I've never even seen a million dollar check [2:07] Yeah, I guess tip it out Sure we don't spill any Ladies and gentlemen that is one million dollars in cash all stays That is so ridiculous.Look at that.That's so crazy.Wow.Whoever is running this really trusts you.They should.Those are loose.Like a lot of these are just fine around here.They have way too much faith in me.Yeah.A lot of faith in you.I mean, this was the proof.I had the idea I was like, I'll bring a prop million dollars on Joe Rogan, but people were, I was thinking then, they already don't believe I have the money.So if I pulled out a prop million and you were like, oh, that's fake money, then I'm like, oh, my turn, So I said to do some bad things for that.So how's one even get a million dollars out of a bank?[3:07] That's gotta be a pain in the ass, right?Yes, so my buddy that's helping me out with this, basically called his bank, he said, I need a million dollars on Thursday, they said, yo, that takes two to three weeks and he's like, get me the million on Thursday, or I'll find a bank that can.And that, I mean, that put the energy in them to get it.Here we are.So what does this guy do that he has all this loot?I really don't want to say.I'm going to keep it all directed.I mean, it's all above board legal, you know what I mean?But we're sort of keeping it mysterious.I want any negative energy towards the tournament coming my direction.Not the anonymous sugar daddy in the background.OK.So you don't want to say like what the business is or does the business profit off of this at all?Does this benefit the business to do this?What are you doing?I mean we're running as a non-profit So like obviously for people that want to support the sport of Jiu-Jitsu Like we're gonna donate basically all the ticket sales of this event towards different charities So we really want to do this as a non-profit because my thoughts were if Jiu-Jitsu doesn't make a profit [4:05] We might as well make a non-profit.Mm, okay.Well, Jiu-Jitsu make no profit?Like Abu Dhabi doesn't turn a profit, right?It's done primarily because of the shakes, love of the sport.Like the, yeah, it's like a passion project, but I mean, sort of my problem with the latest event is like we're selling so many tickets and they Their event is in T-Mobile T-Mobile is super expensive as far as I know I remember their event organized a posted the amount they paid for T-Mobile And it was basically two of these So I was just to rent out the venue just to rent out and then you were at the Thomas and Mac Yeah, so the previous event we're, they were at Thomas and Mac.So I just thought, hey, I might as well check how much Thomas and Mac cost.And it was a lot cheaper.So I might opinion we're really doing this because the prize money's been the same for so long.A lot of events don't pay a lot of money, but obviously ADCC is the biggest.biggest and this sells a lot of ticket sales but really they made a lateral move in the venue that didn't [5:07] really grow much in the way of seating and none of that money really how much is Thomas and Maxi?I think we'll have about 11,000 seats for this one and T-bombs was 18 I think 18 yeah so not massive difference and really ATCC prize money stayed the same.So their prize money you have to win four matches to get 10k not that I'd know because I could never fucking win it but we're gonna pay We're gonna do two divisions and pay a hundred times that amount of money to the division winners So 10k is the winner of ADCC and we're gonna pay 10,000 and one dollars to show up to that's ornament 10,000 and one throw an extra dollar That's for me personally.So anybody who competes gets $10,000.Really?So even if you just get smoked.Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking of the other guys like me and these tournaments that don't make the final compensate everyone, you know?Well, that is nice, but ADCC's never made money, right?So for them, raising the money would just be losing more money.Yeah, I mean, but if, I mean, if you could sell 11,000 seats, [6:08] you know what I mean?Like, if you could sell streaming rights to an event, I feel like some of that should go back towards the athletes rather than just spending it all on production.Like, I, a lot of people talk about the cost of production and it's important to grow a sport, but I really feel like at least the athlete competition should go up a little bit.You know, like in terms of tickets sales, some of that should go back towards the athletes.Even if the ADCC is not making any money at all.But in terms of, they do make money, but it's where they spend it.They choose to spend it on production rather than the athletes.Right, but it's not profitable.Like, in terms of the organization itself is not really profitable, I don't believe.Well, I would imagine if they chose Thomas and Mack with streaming rights and the cost of the venue like that they've spent on T-Mobile, for sure they would have made a profit of this event.You could curtail production costs down.[7:02] Like, it's not gonna be that crazy if you choose the right venue.My opinion is grappling's amazing, but I don't think we're ready for team level.That's a massive, expensive venue.Right.Well, the Thomas and Mack was very impressive last year.It was very impressive.The whole overall production and just the scope of it and the amount of fans that came out to watch ADCC, it was pretty impressive.It's crazy, yeah it's crazy.I've never competed in that many in front of that many people.Four was awesome, it was awesome to go.That was basically my opinion.It's like, while we're making a lateral move in my opinion, one we could still keep the same venue.So what was the idea about going head to head with ADCC?If you want to grow the sport, wouldn't it be better to do it in an alternative weekend?That way the people that competed ADCC can also compete at your event?Well we kind of, I mean yeah, obviously athletes can't do both, but in terms of for the fans, the fans will be able to go to Alvin Friday Saturday, still see ADCC finals on Sunday.But in terms of doing it at the same week and we're really trying to make a stand that the athletes can unify in this sense and we can get compensated better.[8:10] Because again, not the athletes care where we compete.As the sport grows, grappling's growing, obviously, thanks to people like you, you've blown it up.Whenever you shout us out, our followers go up.So the mean, the events are getting more eyes on it.People are more ticket sales.Like we should get at least some token gesture of a payment increase.Well, I think the best case scenario out of this is that ADCC does ramp it up in that the sport does get more eyeballs because people are aware of this huge increase in pay.And then over, I always feel like competition is good.I just don't necessarily like the idea of going head to head because I feel like it just kind of messes with the athletes because you know, it puts them in a situation where they have to choose first of all between ADCC and the Craig Jones invitational.[9:02] And if they do that, ADCC is going to probably hold a grudge.I mean, hopefully not.Well, hopefully they're not.But likely they will.I mean, it doesn't make sense that they would.I mean, if you're kind of crippling their organization by taking the elite guys and offering them potential for like how many people are going to jump ship?Do you know?I mean, who will we go confirm already?We've got Fion Davies past champion.The Taker brothers were the first two with a Nikki Ryan.I'm gonna announce today Nikki Rods jumping across.We got Luke Rockhold in there.We threw him in because he's just he's honestly pretty impressive.He tapped me out in the gym.I was like fuck it.We're throwing man.In terms of the under we got Joseph Chen.So I mean a lot of people are gonna make the move.And what's interesting to me, I can't say any names particularly, but a lot of the old legends, obviously wanna be a part of this event.I think they believe, they wanna support the cause.You know what I mean?And you say make the athletes make a choice.I mean, really they should be able to make the choice if there's an event with such a huge amount of prize money on display.You know, the argument is prestige, first prize money in my argument is, [10:06] the prize money's there, that becomes the most prestigious event.Yeah, it does, it does ramp up the prestige, but will this happen again?Is this a one time thing or are you guys planning on doing multiple ones of these?Yeah, we wanna do it.We don't, 80 CC every two years, so most of the time the guys have to wait every two.We want to do it every year.Well, that would be good.Then there'd be a year where it's not in competition.We don't want to just kill another organization.And then I just disappear off into the sunset.Maybe sneak a couple million.But we want to do it every year for sure.The goal is really to raise money for charities and do some film projects around the world using Jiu-Jitsu really helping out some other privileged kids and stuff.Well, the whole idea of using it for charity is beautiful.That's amazing.But is this guy willing to fork up this kind of, like does he have a commitment to do this more than once?I mean, basically he says if, hey, we do a good job of this one, you can do it every year.He's super invested in, so what did you get to love that?And this guy's just throwing loot away.That's a crazy thing to commit to though.I mean, even no matter how rich you are.[11:06] I mean, because if you're giving away $3 million in prize money, is that what it is?Oh, two.I mean, so how's it go all together?We basically go to budget of $3 million.And we decided to give $2.3 million to the athletes.And the rest, we're going to spend on production.Obviously, we're going to have sponsors come in.we're going to work with the Ticula sponsors, but we're going again, the Ticot sales, that's going to charity.We're really allowing some of the athletes to choose.Like if we have an influential grappler and stuff, we're not really trying to leverage the money we have, we're saying, hey, if we get you on board, we're happy to donate a percentage of the Ticot sales to a charity of your choice.So we give them a bit of freedom in who they Well, that's nice.And if this does go well, like what's the, when you say go well, like what are the guidelines, what are we trying to achieve in terms of like going well to do this again?I mean, based on the investment and how much money we can raise for charity is really the goal there.Like if we can sell out Thomas and Mac and we can demonstrate that we can do this in [12:01] a cost effective way, we can bring in more more sponsors.Definitely gonna keep doing this every year.Well, like I said, I think competition is always great.And I think just more eyeballs and more people pay attention to it is great for the sport.Obviously, I love Jiu-Jitsu.And I think, you know, the athlete's getting paid a million dollars to win first place is fantastic.I mean, because, you know, we both know that most athletes don't make much money off of actual competition.The money that they do make, they usually make in seminars.Only fans.Yeah, holy, that's you.Yeah, that's a lot of underwear I had to sell, you know?Only fans and what else?I guess DVDs.Yeah, I mean, that's the number one revenue source athletes would be instructional.But again, that's like you can win the biggest tournaments in the world It doesn't necessarily translate to seminars doesn't translate to Instructionals really that's the sad thing.It's like you hold certain events so hard that you're like when I win that I'm gonna make it but then there'll be some also like me that never won but outsells you it doesn't make you know I mean, it's like it's not your life's not set if you win one of these events [13:08] But if you win a million as a graph you're pretty well set up especially if you're like a a grappa from a poor country Like a million U.S.and Brazil's gonna go a long long way and also it's it's just gonna elevate the whole profile of the sport Just people knowing that a million dollars is going towards the first place, craftwers.And then like, has UFC Fight Pass had a positive impact?Does that helped at all?For sure.I mean, obviously, it helps so much.Like, my dream's always taking on MMA guys.You know, like they got a cloud, they got the big name.So obviously, UFC Fight Pass helped that happen.But I mean, Tetchies put aacle of sort of professional super fight events.And what is like, like if you fight in UFC Fight Pass, like what is a big payday UFC Fight Pass?I know some of the athletes might get, I don't know how I should say it, Tetsuya will fight kill me, but I mean it's broad, like I could go from 10 to 6 big is really.And again, that's the thing, [14:05] when you compete for an event like a tournament, you might face four guys.Like for me personally, I might face four guys that I could have made much more money facing off in a super fight setting.So really like in terms of the investment, the commitment, the training, the time to prepare for potentially four opponents to win something like $10,000 when if I just had four superfights, it makes so much more money.Obviously, I didn't get the medal.And the amount of money that you're going to spend in camp anyway, just with nutrition, supplements, steroids, the damage to duty of audience.All the jazz, everything, everything.You mean you're spending $10,000 anyway.Your blood pressure goes up, your liver values go up, you push it to the out, you red line it for a thing like IDCC.Well, that is the craziest thing about the sport, is that steroids are openly tolerated.It's probably the only elite professional sport where particularly because of Gordon, because Gordon's been so open about steroids [15:01] that everyone knows that the athletes are on juice.Well, I'm sponsored by a local company called EverTight.And this is the sad thing, I tell people, hey, I'm on TRT and I'm sponsored by them.And no one believes me, they're like, you look so out of shape, there's no way he's just joking.And I'm like, no, believe me, I'm taking turns.Do you look like me?I mean, sometimes, yeah.So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say I'm the worst example of athlete.I don't stretch, don't do any recovery, I don't sleep properly.You don't stretch at all?No, I just go easy the first round.I feel like I'm pushing on my legs.I just hit my ability.I think if you get a bad injury, that's a sign.Maybe it's gonna hang it up, you know?So when you do a little bit of lifting, but man, fucking, I don't even track anything.I'll just be like, oh, that seems like enough lifting for today.Really?Yeah, that's it.Do you ever wonder like if you did like hire like a serious, like strength and conditioning coach and really get after it, it would make a difference in your performance?Maybe, but I mean, like, I mean, if those are millions, I was gonna lie, maybe, but that's a little funny.But it's your whole life.[16:05] I mean, you're a professional jujitsu guy.I mean, I love the technique and the strategy aspect of it.You know, like sometimes when I've lifted or taken more steroids than usual, it's like I'm starting to overly rely on my strength.I love what I love about jujitsu is laying traps, tricking people, making make people feel silly.That's the part I like.Right.Rather than just, I want to look jacks just for me.No feeling for a notch.But don't you think even with the laying traps and just overall your ability to move would be enhanced?It's true, but if I mean if I look too jack and I want to buy the instruction, I said, black, come, fuck and do it, that guy, though.I've got to look like a weathered man man out there.Wow, that's a crazy approach.We got another announcement here today.The biggest super fight in grappling history.We signed it actually.I signed this maybe an hour and a half ago.So I got the contract data.But busted out.Uh oh.[17:00] The biggest super fighting grappling history, really?Yeah, it might be one of the biggest events in...What is the biggest so far?So far, it's probably Gordon and Galval.Yeah, it terms of Val.Hodja Bisesha.Yeah.But now we're talking the most decorated female athlete of all time.Gabi Garcia has put pen to paper to face me on my own event.So we're talking 10-11 time world champion four-time ADCC champion.You have been joking around about this forever.This is actually going to happen.A hundred percent going to happen.We booked that.We signed this contract earlier.So like, I mean, I had to do a lot of things to get it done, you know?What'd you have to do?I had to talk to Gabby a lot.I had to go over there and give her a backdrop.You have to dance with her.I mean, this getting this done, like, she's like a heavy one, staying producing, you know?But I'll do it for the fans.But we got that booked.[18:06] So I mean, she I'll take her on.Wow.I feel good.I probably want to train for I'll be planning this damn event.Say you won't train.I will train that hard I'm happy she's doing it that way.Oh, it took a long time.We've been talking about this for two and a half years Filsing a range marriage or something.I know I was always thinking that it was just.I know we're gonna get, we're gonna get rid of this sexual tension somehow, you know?So we're gonna throw it down.There's one way.Yeah.I mean, that's in the contract if I lose, I have to do some things.Oh no.Maybe sell that on your only fans, but.Oh.Good luck.Good luck.Um, so when this all goes down, are you gonna stream it live and how are you gonna do that?Free on YouTube.Really?Yeah, we wanna put it free on YouTube.Cause like everything I wanna do about this event is to grow the sport.So like, do you just excorings confusing?It's hard to keep up.Some events don't even know the run scoring.And to be honest, I compete in events where I don't even know the rules.You know, I'm just hoping for the best, but this one we're going to do for the lead-up matches, the non-finals, qualifying matches, [19:08] three by five-minute rounds, and we're going to have the judges score according to your traditional judicia.You know, like if you get a good position, it might be a...if there's a four-point discrepancy, something like that.Are you using a specific rule set or are you guys making your own?Making our own one.We want to make it our own one.We want to make it our own completely.So we want to take what you do to guys already know.So we'll have three judges use some sort of pre-existing points system to understand, but we'll have the judges translate into a 10 point mark system.So the MMA fans will understand.So say if there's a, after round one, the guy finishes on the other guys back.The rest stops up.We get out.We have a minute break.That's a strong position.We'll score that at 10-8th.And we'll do open scoring.So, Jiu-Jitsu guys are used to knowing the score as the match progresses.They don't like the surprises.Like MMA, it's the surprise at the end.Jiu-Jitsu guys, they don't want things to be two different.So, we're basically keeping it very similar to what they already already understand while trying to introduce it in a way that's friendly to fans that you [20:06] knew.Because fans that you know what the fuck's happening.And the guy you see he won the round tonight.I wish that MMA had opened scoring because it would expose a lot of really bad scoring.You know where you're at.Yeah.Because there's so many times where it's just not.And the argument against it I think is silly because the argument against it is that the person would coast if they were ahead, but my feeling is that would make the person who's behind really get after it because they know they're behind.You know, and then in fights where you know a guy's ahead and the guy's getting tooled up, that's already the case.There's no, you know, like if like, Adesanya is fighting somebody and he's just dominating the fight.We all know that.We all know that.And the only thing that could fuck him is a bad judge.Some crazy judge.Yeah.And we've seen that.We've seen like two scores that are like, that's right.And then one score, one judge is like, what the fuck was that guy watching?That's the guy we're going to hire for out of that.That guy's going gonna be cheap.Why?That guy's gonna be dangerous.[21:06] Why 10-8?Like, well, I don't even like 10-8 for MMA.I think it sucks.I mean, just for a way that we can grow, like we can have it easy to digest.I mean, I guess MMA is still pretty confusing, but we want MMA fans, we want to steal MMA fans.Like, that's probably my whole strategy.I'll take on guys in the UFC because I know that drug tests that I'm not and I'll be like and they're famous It's like a perfect match up But we want to do that because we want to steal their fans and we're also changing It's very fucking expensive actually every jujitsu event is basically on an elevated stage or just on mats And we have this problem where there's all these weird resets like guys might fall off the stage Yeah, the crashing of the table.That's crazy.So inspired by Karate Combat, we're going to do a rectangular mat space with that angled wall.Because there's nowhere to run.And we're going to call this rectangular mat space the alley.You basically only hit the back alley to fight or fuck.But isn't the angled wall a bit of a problem?[22:03] Like I saw your match with Phil Bro.Yeah.And the angled wall like all of a sudden he's fucked because you're just gonna go down Like it's not like a wall like a wall.I don't like the cage in MMA I've said multiple times.I really think they should be fighting in a basketball court Just make it all matted up have a long red line We're gonna bring it big 30 by 40.It's gonna be massive.That is big.So we heard the possible call up but we threw some angles on the end.Well, punishes them.We wanna punish guys for backing up.Okay.So like again, like you said with the caves, they back up but they remain vertical and guys are so like you can use that angle to not get taken down.But if you back up, if you're running away we want it to be detrimental to you while not having any referee interruption.So if I'm like you said, I see one of the first round 10, 8, I'm coasting, I'm backing up.That guy can chase me and there's nowhere I can go.And if I back up, it's detrimental to me.I want to ask you a specific question about the Philip Rhoffite because he posted his arm down to like against the angle.And I was like, well, you're kind of fucked if you're doing that.[23:06] And then you threw up the triangle and you trapped him.But like, did you train for that?So this is this setup.And this is in karate combat, which is by the way in Austin this Thursday.I'm gonna go down and check that out.Oh, that's a good show.So like this.Like when he posted his arm down, I'm like, oh no, that's honestly, here's the funny thing about it is As in the promoter said to me goes bro, we've got to sell the angled wall for grappling He's like, can you try to submit him off the wall and I was like, fuck yeah, I'll do that But I was like I was like, I got no plans of that They asked you to do it.Oh, they said they said that'd be cool if you could have an overhook, and we can put weight on that hand, they can't lift it off the ground, so we can shoot a triangle pretty easy.So, as soon as I saw him, I've got an overhook here, we've got the Russian tire.As soon as I see him put that right hand on the floor, I was like, we can do something flying.And flying shit, but you throw an angle in there.I'll give it a crack [24:08] Well, especially with everything padded up like that on the walls.Yeah But man me and Phil were laughing before this match like we would you I had a couple beers before this I thought we're just gonna have a good time You got a couple beers before the match.Yeah, Phil said he was gonna drink it to kill a shot to sell the match, but then I saw him put water in his cup.I was like, I'll be a misled here.And then we went out there and I didn't even know the time of the match.There was eight minutes.Then the guys got 12 minute match on my, oh fuck.And then his coach started cornering serious.I was like, what have I got myself into?I was like, better give it a crowd though.We're You really had a couple of beers?Yeah, I do do sometimes, you know.Do you really?Take the edge off, yeah.Does it fuck with your performance at all?You know what?I never know what helps my performance or makes it worse.You know, I never have like...Taking the edge off might help.I think so because I do a long training camp.Sometimes I'm like thinking every day, putting pressure on myself.But like, I finished that match and because I hit a flying thing we just got hammered that now.I was [25:05] celebrating and then the next time I was like, I have to face Lovato next week.I thought, what have I done?So it's like sometimes I guess the John Jones approach, you know, having some fun the week before it takes the edge off.Relaxes me.Ilya Tuporia does that too.He gets drunk on Thursday night when he weighs in on Friday.That's why I don't like what he did to my man, but I respect the drinking of the wine for sure.Yeah.That fight, I wanted to talk to you about that too.I wanted to talk to you about just the Volkanowski fight in training him in general.Like, did you try, did you try in any way to discourage him from taking the market share fight on 10 days notice?Sure.Now, I mean, I'm not involved in that process at all.You know, like, I got the code that was happening.Like, he called me, I mean, I was jet-like at the time.I just got into Austin for a day and I get a call at 4M from Vogue.He's like, I think I have a Maca-Chef booked in two.Were you apprehensive about him taking that fight on such short notice?[26:08] I mean, I wouldn't say apprehensive.I like believing him fully.I knew it would be a very difficult challenge.I didn't know what sort of shape he was into the time I didn't see him for a while.But like I believe in him that he can do it.And it's like I'm going to just do everything I can to get him ready for that moment.And yeah, I mean it is the risk of the game, you know, especially you take a short notice fight like that.He had been training at all.I honestly don't know.I don't think he, like he wasn't in the same shape he was for the previous match.I've filed a previous match.I was down in Wollongong with his team freestyle for like six to eight weeks, helping him prepare for that one.But I mean, this one, yeah, such a one, I don't know.Well, that made it such a huge difference the six to eight weeks, just the fact that he was able to survive on the ground the way he was.And not just that, but just not just survive, but be completely safe.He was never even close to being threatened [27:02] with a submission, you know, and the fact that he was like laughing and all of them punching him from behind and...It's crazy, yeah.I mean, I can't take too much credit for that.The guy just is an animal.He's an animal.Yeah, he's just a monster.So hard to hold down, even for me to hold down.I don't get it.I'm like, fuck, you 145.This shouldn't be the case, Well, also he used to weigh 214 pounds and you still got those fucking tendons from being a big gorilla.That's true.Yeah, the rugby day is that's crazy.I mean, I trained when I trained at his gym, one of the rugby plays come in actually and I was just fucking around rolling with him and he put me in a chin strap and I was stuck.I was like, fuck, thank God these guys might grill money and other sports.I have to do this shit.Yeah, it's a hard sport that Americans don't necessarily appreciate.They don't understand.Like, those are guys that could compete in the NFL.They said they're playing rugby because they live in a different country.But it's...When Volkanovsky fought the first time and he was perfectly prepared, it was an amazing fight.I thought he won.[28:00] I thought it was very close, but I thought he won.I think round two was the difference and I could see round two going either way, but I thought it was very close, but I thought he won.I gave, I think round two was the difference.And I could see round two going either way, but I gave it to Volk.But I was like, when, when they announced it, the rematch, part of me was like, ooh, that's great fight.But the other part of me was like, eee, this is the number one, in my opinion, this is the fight for number one pound for pound, right?I believe Volk won the first fight, although very close.It's, I don't think it's a robbery, but it's very close.And I think that puts him as the number one pound for pound fighter in the world.And then he loses the fight to Islam.He gets caught with that head kick and then he gets knocked out by Toporia.Now he's not even in the conversation anymore.So this is a short amount of time, you know, and then everything kind of falls apart.And I think it wouldn't have fallen apart if not for the rematch.It wasn't for the reason.If he just waited for Tupuria, I think I gotta think that head kick has a factor.I mean, to get brained like that with a shin to the dome, which is the worst way to get knocked [29:01] out, you know, it's so much power in legs.I mean, your legs are carrying your legs are carrying your body around all day.I don't think people that have never been kicked understand how much more power is in a leg.Yeah, I wouldn't know.You get head kicked like that and then you fight the guy who's obviously the most dangerous boxer in the division in the next fight and get KO'd.I mean, yeah, it's crazy.I don't know the, I've had a couple of concussions from grappling like accidents, but I don't, yeah, accidents.Always that one, you know, I'm going crazy, but I don't know really the effects of that.It's so hard to judge like it's like, I don't know what testing they can do, but it's like, they can't do much unfortunately they do they're there are some tests but the reality is every time you get knocked out it's easier for that person to get knocked out again and psychology I think for the opponents like for me coaching valks like there were matches where like even with the fights when like say well take out him in the sub and it's like when he keeps doing [30:01] these impossible things you believe in the the myth of yoga more and more, and how the fight is due to, they go, we couldn't submit him, look how deep we'll take it.Well, it's his heart is just unstoppable.But I think when a guy gets clipped like that, everyone else goes, they suddenly have a bit more self-believe.So I think it's like two factors.Yeah, I think you're probably right.but I think Toporia thought he was going to do that to him anyway, but I was just loved to have seen him fully recover from that.Like when Manipack-yau got knocked out by Marquez, Freddie Roach wouldn't let him do anything for a year.He's like, you're going to take one year off.He's like, this is the only way you have to, and Freddie Roach who has trauma-induced Parkinson's from his boxing career.He's well aware of the impact of brain damage.And you know, it's so tricky because I'm just such a huge valk fan.I just look, I wish I had his ear.I don't know if you would have listened to me, but if I had his ear.I think that's what makes those guys special those that they don't, they're like it's the self belief.100%.That's what makes you a champion.You cannot become a Volkanowski [31:06] without this unstoppable belief in yourself.Me and him are the complete opposite.Hey, if someone was like, bro, you're probably gonna lose.I'm like, yeah, you make a good point.I'm like, how much do they pay me?We're a complete opposite.And he takes everything super serious, sporting everything.I mean, the thing about your joking around and being silly about it all is like, you are, but your technique is very, very good.Obviously, you are obviously or one of the elite guys in the world when it comes to technique.So it's not, you are serious.Yeah, I mean personality type, you know?Yeah.But I guess we have the Australian bond.He has faith in me, more faith in me than the guy that gave me this, I think.They both probably shouldn't know.What is a walk up to now?I think he's talking about...I think he's in Thailand training at Bangtow with his...So, folks, wrestling coach Frank Hickman, they have a gym in Thailand, so he's out in Bangtow again in some workin'.I wanna get him a grappling match.I said to him, I said man, like if we're gonna take some time away [32:06] cause of the concussions, let's get you a grappling match.And my thought was, how cool would it be to see him and Ortega have a grappling match?Oh my God, that would be incredible.I would just love to see it in that setting cause Ortega obviously struggles to submit him in MMA.Grapping match right with no gloves to yeah, that would be very interesting or take us very good on the ground He's very sneaky too Yeah, so yeah, he's super slick.He pull he catch some crazy shit out there He losing a fight like two three rounds get one look at a guillotine.Mm-hmm.It's crazy No, and his guillotine is fucking death.I mean when Volcanowski got out of that the mounted guillotine his face looked like like a grape and just would not tap would not tap I had no idea how he got out but I told everyone I was like yeah obviously that's me by the DVD and then support his traveling coach I take credit for that he's an animal 99.9% of the world were tapped he's like that in the gym I remember I'll choke him in the gym [33:01] sometimes and he'll go from putting his chin in To taking it out as your grips in there like he'll try and switch it from like I guess like the front choke to the to the Blive vessels he just changes how you choke him and can survive down there.Wow.I don't know how he does it.He should teach me that shit I think it's just his brain to yeah, too tough.Yeah, he's a fucking animal And so does he have a plan to come back?Does he...I don't know what's going on.I imagine it's probably Holloway vs.Toporia.I think that's gonna happen.And then I think I hope personally we get Volks of Grappin' Match.Maybe we get him at this event.I'm hoping we get him, we get some MMA guys at this event.Is he thinking about doing something like that?He has been playing You have to hold a lot of time, right?When is this?This is August 16, 17th.Yeah, so not much time, but I mean, if he's in shape, his training is out of Bangtown, Thailand, get some rounds in.I think it's fine, especially against another MMA guy.They both have the same type of training.You know, it's not like, he's taking on a pure grappler that's only grappling.So do you have a budget to do super fights as well?Actually, yeah.So we're going to start taking sponsors to try and get more super fights.[34:06] And I'm in talks with some legends of the game right now.Like some guys that you'd be shocked.Can you say it, me up.I wouldn't say any names, but potentially, I'll tell you your name.I'm in the age of prime.One of them has a Mexican sound in last name, but I'll talk to you about that.Okay.All that one.Yeah, all the legends.They want so many people in a commada or a time for this.I think they just know, especially when I explain the rules, explain that it's in that.Allie's like the sunken floor.You know, they like that format.Obviously, you throw a million dollars on the Instagram, you get some messages.You know what I mean, you get some, hey brother, what's going on, you know?Yeah, I think people are gonna be shocked at how good Luke Rockhold is.Yeah, he, man, he's so tough.He's very good on the ground.I remember when he got widened down and mounted him and widened him, we could not get up.I was like, this is, his ground game is very underrated because he's just known as an MMA guy.And he's gonna come train with us.He's gonna come to beat him five weeks.[35:05] So he's gonna prepare with us for this event.So we'll watch him and Nicky wrote, kill each other every day.I'll love the watch that shit.Wow.Yeah, I always wondered how he would have done if he had gone straight grappling.Cause the people that I know that trained with him said, dude, I think, he'd look at the guys he's training with, good beabin' Islam, came for Lascaz, DC, all those guys.It's like, people think it's like, it's like an amazing isolation, like those skills weren't translate, they translate, especially with athletes like that.Especially in such a grappling-dominated camp.He's gonna surprise some for.What you're looking for is like, $1 million for first place, $10,000 for second place.I'm like, who's tapping?Right, for $1 million.Yeah, I think what we're going to do, I haven't finalized this yet, but I think if you're in a submission in the round ends, we keep going.Get out of this arm bar to join the team.Look at that one.I don't get any money out of that.[36:06] How bad was his arm fucked up after that?That arm bar was so tight?Well, that was the funny thing, right?Is that what's the prize of EBI?Well, he had some, if I had submitted him, I would have won 15K.And I think he had only had two submissions in regulation.So he was, he only made 10k so I like we could have made a business still there for a very long time just let it go but man I he's on popped on the day said it was fine next week I shot we both competing in another event again and there was like three four locker rooms and I'll I would just travel by myself I wouldn't even have a coach I just post an Instagram story who can corner me for this event like the one one against Gordon had Denny Prokobos and he was saying 10th planet stuff to me and I didn't even know what language he was speaking in the corner.All right.So I was cracking control.Yeah.He sang do these things.I'm like, what's happening, bro?And then I shopped to this next event, yeah, Kassai grappling in New York.[37:05] And of all the locker rooms, I know how guys and I'm just like this a bit weird, like how this guy known by last week, then he choked me and now it's just me in a locker room with him, I was very awkward but then broke the ice and came in the train the next week.And you were with them for a long time, you were with them for like what, five years?With Danahe?Two years.Two years.So what did start before Puerto Rico?Yes, yeah, I lived in New York for, oh, I mean, man, my memory's hazy, but we did Puerto, we survived Puerto Rico for six months, and before that was, I would come and go from New York.I'll split with a team two and a half years, but yeah, things get weird out there in the jungle, you know?Yeah, nips down style.Well, everyone's confused as to what happened with you guys.That's what like there's no real version of the truth.We got a book deal.We got a movie deal coming out.And now I'm gonna exploit that story to the bitter hands.You have a book deal for real?No, I'm checked.But I could.The story's weird enough, you know.But what happened with you guys?I mean, there's so many things we really can't discuss, you know?A lot of problems, obviously, a lot of problems.[38:06] Obviously, two brothers split up.It was gonna be some serious issues there.Mm-hmm.But yeah, it's not really my place to say, but hopefully one day it comes out.I think it'll be an interesting story.Who knows, this shit might kick things off.It might be well both three again.So when you left, like how did you leave to start your own place when you guys started B team was at the plan all along?Now, I honestly never even wanted to start a gym.I'd already told the guys like at Danahuzz that I was like, Hey, I'm gonna this be my last at ECC.And then I just want to travel around, see the world, visit interesting destinations, teach seminars, like I felt like I'd already built a brand.But then when the team split, I felt like I sort of wanted to help them kickstart something.So we came here, we started the B team.I've been with the B team two or three years, but I'm not there too much anymore.You know, I helped kickstart out.We got the gym.The guys haven't.You know?So like I like traveling around.[39:01] So are you basically semi-retired?For sure, yeah, for sure.I mean, obviously, when you put on, like, if you put on an event that pisses off every other promotion in the sport, it's going to probably be hard to get matches in the future.So I'll probably compete for my own show and that's it.That's the plan we want to keep doing these shows.Well, I think you're going to piss off ADCC for sure by going head to head with them, but I don't think it would piss off fight pass or a fire pass number one.Do you think?Well, I mean, if whoever is streaming ADCCs, obviously, not going to be happy as I was more competition.But again, I still think long-term, this story is going to grow this.What?Yeah.It's interesting story.It's fine.Let's see.Let's see what happens.It'd either be the best event ever or the five festival.I'm hoping for the the former Festival are you are you Besides the Gabby Garcia thing which is you know no disrespect kind of a gimmick fight.Yeah for sure.Yeah Um, are you Done competing oh, we do another match.That's Gabby Gabby will be one day if someone's down [40:03] I'll do a match on the other day as well.We'll see, but I also want to leave it open because I am talking to some crazy big names, and I'm like, man, if we can put that together, like I'm going to try and save some space, but like, obviously, I have to run this thing.But what you can tell me some of those names on the air?It's everyone you can possibly think of.I'll tell you how to do that.This is a potential matchup that I'm working on.That's insane.It'll be the craziest shit ever.Really?Crazy, yeah.You wanna tell me now what cut it out?Yeah, can we do that?Yeah, yeah.I'm working a holy shit.Sorry folks, you can't know.Damn, that would be insane.That would be insane.Wow, is the former, is he training?Training, yep.People have said, man, he feels good.It'd be like obviously crazy inspiration story.I'd love it.Wow.Yeah.That's insane.That's insane.And then it's like Abu Dhabi for a lot of people [41:01] is the Olympics of grappling.And one of the things is it's every two years i mean i remember when john jacke uh...one obeldaabee you know i just started i think this is like what year was this when he started training when he uh...fought obeldaabee early two thousand from it to have a i think i was like a blue belt at the time and when john jacke went over there we're we're just so John Jock went over there we were just so proud that he went over there and he had this advantage over a lot of the key guys and that he only has one hand and so he never relied on grabbing collars.Everything was over hooks and under hooks and he had sort of already developed a no-gee game that he was applying to the key.You know obviously he could do all the key techniques as well but he was more of a no-gey game that he was applying to the G.You know, obviously he could do all the G techniques as well, but he was more of a no-gey guy in the beginning.And it was so interesting watching that style, you know, watching no-gey, which is, if Abu Dhabi didn't do that, and if they didn't have this prestigious event and make it no-gey, I think the sport would have really [42:02] struggled because it's so hard for people to appreciate what's going on with the key.It's very slow and when you see a guy getting choked by a collar it's just...It looks silly, but yeah, but yeah, oh man, I'm so happy I would be able to be exists.I think the inspiration of me to do ADCC was Stuart Cooper's Highlight Rills.Like when I was coming up, like, 2009, 2011, Cimbraleo, Anjagav Alz runs, like that, inspired me.Losing in the game more than No Gilson inspired me to chase the No Gil Dreams.But like, I'm following in Eddie Bravas for steps, you know, we both did ADCC, couldn't win it.We have our own invitational.But yeah, I, thankful have a career as big as it is without ADCC.But do you feel any loyalty to ADCC?Like you're kind of fucking them, right?I mean, I feel loyalty to the athletes.I think like for what we do and how much, how much bigger the sport is now we should be compensated better, you know?Like, and that's sort of why I've taken a massive risk in doing this.[43:01] I appreciate what you're saying, but if ADC is not turning a profit, like the idea of composing the athletes more, I mean, they have essentially made stars out of so many of these athletes, and by because of that, by the fact of that, they've profited.But therein was the argument, and the argument is that I believe an event of that magnitude should turn a profit.I'm going to do it myself and see.Obviously, I could be wrong, but based on the production and the things we've paid for thus far, I don't see how you couldn't run it in a profitable way.Obviously, we're giving away 100 times as much for two divisions.But, man, if they had even upped it to 20k, you know what I mean?Let some token gesture, like if we're going from a basketball court with a hundred people in there to selling out team mobile.Like if there's room for a fireworks show, if there's room for dramas, I feel like there should be some room in the budget for the athlete pay.[44:01] To the crease.No that's a good argument and hopefully by forcing by this you guys will like inspire them.And the argument is about making stars like it's true it's true it's true obviously get a huge platform but you could win and not become a star.You know if I know plenty of guys well not plenty of guys but I know a few people that have won ADCC but really like.No one knows who they are.Yeah that, that's crazy for me.It's all go to the seminon, it'll sell out just because of just fucking gay jokes and stupid jokes all the time.And I'll see real champions that can't sell out a seminon.So if we can make an event that those champions can make some real money and I'd be super happy.Well, I think you're also your popularity is increased because people know that you coach Volkanovsky and you work with MMA athletes before.Do you plan on still doing that?For sure, yeah, for sure.Love Volkanovsky always be there for him anytime.I mean, obviously MMA's got a lot of crazy individuals in there, but like to give up the time to work with the correct athletes, [45:00] I will always have time for some of the real good guys out there like obviously easy awesome I'd always make time for Izzy Jack Della from Perth Like guys like that just super cool guys.I'd always find time to help him.Yeah Jack Della What a big when he got over Gilbert Man, I still moves off him.I remember when he went in the contender series He hit like a monkey comey reversal in the first round of the contender series fight And I was blown away by his grappling and I've been watching it since and he's reverse with Gilbert Burns.It's crazy.I've trained with him and I'm just like I still move from him.Like he's man.He's so good at grappling.Yeah, he's a very good at striking too.He's in my opinion, he's like one of the best in the sport at mixing up shots from the body to the head.Because so many fighters for whatever reason are head hunters.And because you can not go out with one shot, but Jack is so good at mixing shots up to the body and to the head.He just breaks guys down.Yeah, it's amazing, scary guy.I was lucky actually, because before the Tuporiify, we were able to sort of link up.[46:00] So it was like he came out to Willem Gong and trained, Izzy came out at the same time so I got to watch Jack Deller and Izzy mixed it up and then trained with folks and for me even as MMA fan it's like I have to pinch myself sometimes and be like wow that's amazing.He's just like putting on this thing when I'm talking to these guys about superfights it's the dream as just a grappling fan I'm just thinking oh what could we do who could we convince into this event?You know, like just from a pure fan perspective, it is pretty fun No, I'm sure it's it's gonna be interesting to see whether or not this can work Because a lot of people have like looked at the UFC model and said hey athletes should be getting paid more money And so they put on these events and none of them are profitable I mean maybe Bellator was and they sold Bellator and then there's the PFL.I don't know how they do financially, but they have the same sort of similar thing.They have a tournament.At the end of the tournament, the guy wins a million dollars.But my point is, right, is like, if you're an Olympic champion or if you're a UFC champion, it has so much prestige that every single person in the world knows what it is.It has this intrinsic value.Yeah.If you say you're an IBGF champion or an ADCC champion, [47:08] a very small percentage of population know that.So it's like, that's a case in point we've put on a tournament with much more money.Everyone jumpships, because they know that's money whereas obviously Olympic gold medal, that's timeless.That's crosses all sports, you know, that crosses into culture.How many guys are jumping ship?I mean, I'll tell you afterwards, but...So is it public that they're jumping ship or are they not talking about it?Well, we got 16 spots spots in under and over and I'm navigating through who wants to be in there.You know, 16 spots spots each so 32 total.So I'm trying to navigate to the best guys we can get and it's like everyone wants in, you know?Really, so no one's worried about the repercussions or the blowback from ADCC?Now, because I think they see it as well, I could get the money to show.[48:01] Like I mean, so the TACA brothers, local Texas guys, some of the nicest kids ever, you know, and they were the first ones to reach out to me.They wanted the trials.It's been 80 CCs been their dream their entire life and they just hit me up because no one believes anything I say unfortunately.It's like you make too many jokes every once in a while.He's full of shit.But these guys were like, man, is this real?And I was like, yeah, it's real.And they're like, well, even if I have to deal with the consequences, even if I have to go back and win the trials to qualify again, I want to show the million to take, and then I don't even talk about themselves.I want to take care of my family.And I'm like, wow, that's a super cool motivation to do this.They're willing to risk it because they'll fight their way back in.Well, we'll see.But I think best case scenario is that ADCC recognizes that there's competition and they have to raise up the amount of money to get the athletes.Maybe it'll just elevate the profile of the sport enough so that's profitable still.Yeah, it's a good experiment.[49:00] Press stage versus...But why do it the same weekend as them?Well, the athletes to make a stand, you know, are they together?Or, you know, what is the motivation here for these guys?Yeah, for the money's the motivation.Money is a shot.It's sort of making a stand, but it's making a stand.Money is more important in this organization that's propped up the sport for 20 plus years.Well, there's other athletes that say a million dollars is easy to make.You know, yeah, you mean that?It's easy for Gordon.I mean, Gordon makes a lot of money.I mean, Gordon makes a lot of money through the structural notes.Oh, it's just from dominating for all these years.But again, like a million for most guys, like I mean, you grow up in Brazil.You know, you like millions, not easy to make by any means like especially like the instructional market is predominantly English speaking people They're the ones that are gonna pay the highest price so it's like us that speak English Have a huge advantage in that area like even me personally just for having an accent.I'm a little Americans like wow He's fucking smarter.That's why we use people like you for infomercials.Yeah, exactly.They take it I mean little mop John Denny you throw a kiwi accent on it.Yeah [50:07] He's obviously smart guy, but that adds points for sure.Are you still close to him?Do you talk to him?No, we don't talk.So he's upset about this.I don't know.I've run into him a few times with shake hands, but you know he's general demeanor.You don't really know, like, you know?Yeah.I look back See, there's nothing I've come in.But I held him hard a few buddies in New York, you know, some missing women.But we had a tight bond.He's a unique character.I mean, he seems like a guy from a fucking movie.Like, he doesn't even seem like a real guy.You know, some professor of philosophy, a Columbia, who becomes obsessed with Jiu-Jitsu, sleeps on the mats, teaches everybody, and forces everybody to train 365 days a year.Yeah, that's an interesting fellow.What was it like doing that, like the 365 days a year?I mean, I wouldn't do it.You know, I would be like, well, it's taking a day off.Let me have a day to relax.I wouldn't necessarily do it.[51:00] I mean, it was a lot of training though.He can't like, he wanted it to be your life, you know, like, and obviously it should be, but a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure to be a part of that team.Did you talk to him about the philosophy behind those decisions?I mean, we had a lot of discussions, I think, like we were actually really close because I'm from, like he's New Zealand, I'm a straight, I'm from his part of the world.So a lot of the time Australians visit, he actually has a tight connection with them because we have a lot of things we can relate on.So we, I mean, we talk all the time.I'd probably, unfortunately, probably me and Nicky Ryan were two of the ones he was closest to before the team split.Hmm.And when you guys were training there, how beneficial is it having a guy like him around?Super beneficial and also not just because of who he is and how smart he is, but like he basically approached it like an MMA coach.You know, like MMA coach is always watching.He's always guiding your training.Most you do to coaches are participating.They teach you a few moves.They roll with everyone.So to have a guy that approaches it like an MMA coach where he approaches it with that level of professionalism [52:06] Watching making adjustments.I think even something as simple as that is a huge benefit Yeah, I think so too also a guy who's Physically impaired where he can't compete, but he has so much passion for it that he pours it all into the athletes Yeah, and I think what made him so brilliant as well is obviously his college and university.He knows how to study, he knows how to take notes on everything, he knows how to teach.You put him in Hens or Gracie's in New York for 20 years when it was the hub of MMA and grappling.Guys like Hodja Gracie are passing through all the time.He's basically in this position where he can just watch, train with all these guys, pick up all these details and have it locked and loaded, read it, and teach in a perfect way.Like obviously his game's heavily inspired by Marcelo Garcia.You know that he just takes the really useful things and can articulate it in a way that's [53:03] better than most of the people in the sport before.So I think there's all these factors that have made him who he is and why he's so successful.How much of a factor is this, the constant training, the training of 365 days?You're like, how do you balance the burnout with the discipline?Like, how do you, like, because I think inspiration is almost enthusiasm and inspiration are almost, I think discipline is more important for sure, but there are factors that can't be ignored because when an athlete loses inspiration and loses enthusiasm, they just don't have the mental drive to push through like very difficult situations.You know what I'm saying?Like you just lose the steam, you lose the engine.I mean I don't think you should do 365 a year.You know like I think you should peak for events, have a period of time afterwards where you slow down.[54:00] And then when you're not preparing for an event, you're studying technique.When you get closer to an event, you're studying technique, when you get closer to an event, you're refining those particular techniques and skills for that particular event's rule set or opponent or whatever, and we should like go up and down and like, I like it when you have an event, whether you win or lose, you don't train too much after and you have this period where you miss training, and you're like pulled back into it.So I do, and I think, I mean, even like, obviously Gordon's had four sprages with healthy issues, but like as long as I've known him, and we trained together, like there would be time periods where he wouldn't be at training for a week or two.You know, so it's like, I think it's like a myth we should all strive for, but everyone should be entitled to some time off.Did you ever talk to John about that?I mean, I would just take a day off every week, but luckily, I think he had some love for the Australians.Let me get away with some things.He wouldn't let other people do.So I mean, I would be chilling, you know?Does he enforce that?Like the 365 days a week?I mean, I don't know if there's a real strong enforcement, but there's like a unspoken, he'd better be there, you know, like, but I don't who knows what it's like now obviously he's moved to Austin.My memory is probably phasier, [55:08] pretty forgot some things but yeah obviously I'm super appreciative that I had.It was a part of that team but I mean I was with like Lockling, I'm lucky.I moved to Melbourne, it was with Lockling Jarls for a few years, I had a massive splash at ADCC 2019 and then I was with John.So like I've been around some good coaches, you know, so I think I like your position to spite coming from Australia.Not as lucky as others.Like it would have been amazing to be like a Nicky Ryan born right next to New York and go to train with someone with the people in that team or have that coaches.But again, like we're all not that lucky.I didn't even train with a black belt.I was already a purple belt.So it's like we were really yeah We were one exposed cuz I'm from Australia I probably came up with a time period in my city that was more like an older time in the US where black belts were like whoa Never met one.What year did you start training?Oh Probably [56:00] 17 years ago now and even back then there weren't many black belts around?No, when I started training, I just trained with my cousin and he was like a four-stripe white belt.There was like two people on the mats.There was nothing I trained twice a week.I didn't train properly for a long time.You trained twice a week?Yeah, I was just like, I didn't even think, I didn't even know then I was just flipping burgers at Burger King basically.Then I did a psychology degree, just a bachelor's, some bouts.Like I had to work jobs, study end-duty, so these are souls today that get it just trained.I'm so envious of them, you know?Like it's just the sport, again, the sport's growing that much with the sponsorship deals and stuff.So back then, how did you learn technique?Man, I had Eddie, like he's the funny thing.I had Eddie Brava's Monster in the Rubbergaard book.That came to me at a very influential time where I read the chapter about weed.I was like, fuck it, maybe I should start smoking weed.So like, I was like, thinking I'm going to learn some techniques and then I'm smoking weed all the time.[57:06] Yeah, that doesn't work for everybody.It's interesting the wheat thing, because some people think it makes you lazy.And I think you're just lazy.I think if we'd make you lazy, you're lazy.I just, I don't, I don't, it makes me think about the consequence.Like the idea of paranoia, like people talk about weed paranoia, I think it's like a hyper awareness.And you know, Eddie once said this to me, like if your life is shit and you smoke weed, it's gonna feel terrible.But if your life is great and you smoke weed, you're gonna feel good.Like if you got all, you don't have any problems in your life, you know, if you're doing things you're dealing with, if you've dealt with your problems and you're just than weed's good for you.But weed has never made me lazy.It's the opposite.I smoke weed.I always feel like, don't be lazy.Good, good, good, good things to do.You don't want these things fucking with you.You don't want these things hanging over your head.Like that hyper awareness, it's like part of my work ethic.You know, like the like oversight.[58:00] Like someone is looking over me all the time, making sure I can't lie to myself or to other people.Like I have to do the things I'm actually supposed to do.That's my feeling about it.Well, I mean, I read his book and I was like 17 smoking bongs driving a training in the car, having pre-workout getting ready to go to war, you know, like that's basically, they have floats that out on me.But it was good.I think roll it, like rolling high keeps you fluent, keeps you, I wouldn't do all the time.Sometimes I meet guys that are so high that I've just smashed them for a round but they don't want to think but they're so fascinated by that, like the perceptions of sometimes.I think that's possible, true.That's too.But I've always felt like I was like 10%'s, it was quite a few things.You could try a couple beers.I'm scared.Beers don't help me.Like, when I play pool, if I play pool high, I play way better.If I play pool drunk, I'm not good.Oh, really?Yeah, I think with me, alcohol just makes me not pay attention to shit.Alcohol for me is like, ah!I'm not, I'm not a focused person if I'm drinking.I need that for sport that gives me a false sense of confidence.[59:05] You know, that's useful.Maybe one or two beers with drunk.Have you ever competed drunk?I've felt it for sure, you know?Cigina, be actually usually a focused soda or something.So if a fan sees, I'm not soda water man.And you've done that many times were you just to take the edge off?Five, six times.I mean, I was, I had a couple drinks before the lavado match because we had the hell ahead bottle back there.I was like, hey, come on, tell us some sponsorship money, you know?I picked that up, but sadly not.Well, isn't how we're headed home by Dana?Doesn't Dana?Yeah, that was the thing.I was sneak us a bottle back in, put it in the vlog.Um, when you were training and you were learning from books, like, did you have any videos that you studied?Was it like, how did you learn techniques other than just books?I mean, we, I'm trying to make books I had, man.I had like a PJ Penn's book, Eddie Bravis book, like the actual textbooks.[1:00:01] And then I started buying the instruction.I was like I had Caraporation as judo for MMA.I had Ryan Hulls.He really changed the game with instruction was in the early days.So like stealing Liz moves and then I learned about the world of torrent sites and I started illegally acquiring every instruction I could and then we try to self-learn on the mats studying these and then drilling the moves.That's really so I was really self-taught up until Purple Bell, really just focused on using instructions.And then where'd you go for Purple Bell?Then I moved to Melbourne with Lockland Jaws, and basically it was like two and a half years then, two and a half years with John.That's a crazy little amount of time.Yeah, I didn't expect, that's the thing a lot of people obviously they just notice when you achieve something You know, I mean so like I trained by myself a long time before I was able to join any big teams What do you think attributed to your success?I think I mean, I honestly I don't know I put in the work in the early days for sure and then studying studying studying and then just being at the forefront of [1:01:03] the leg lock sort of song you know like I got in the right time.I saw techniques in the G like the Birren Bolo that were just a new technique that would wipe the floor with experience black belts.You could use it on people you had no business beating.Those are the techniques I wanted and I saw the Danahau guys use heel hooks and I was like man if I as a purple belt can submit some black belts I might as fuck it and that's that's the way I gotta go and so how did you wind up training with John and the Well, I mean I would Joe's obviously Australia's far away hard for us to me to keep doing that 16 hour journey back and forth I wanted to stay in America, so I just started doing my camp set That was the best place to do it.It was like a hundred people in the room doing nogy.Obviously it had that DDS squad there that was awesome Dana her focus at that time that really weren't too many places in the world that would take nogy is seriously as those guys How bad was the staff infections going around down there?I got staff every month every month there I'm remember how the fuck is that possible?[1:02:05] I go, I got it under my eye one time and the guy was the doctor was like, well, that's your eye fucked.I was like, oh, it's reassuring.Hey, thank you.But yeah, every month I was on, I remember I used to go trips to Mexico to get some medicine.So I'd go down there by a bunch of doxy cycling, by like 90 tablets of it.I just sit on it, keep tagging them.Used to buy my steroids down in Mexico too.But isn't that, that's probably what fuck Gordon stomach up.The steroids?No, I mean the, the, the, and I don't think the steroids.Yeah, probably, probably everything.Who knows, yeah.The, the anybody, it's definitely not good for you.But when you're on antibiotics, he was on antibiotics for a year straight.Which first of all is crazy because the amount of discipline it takes to train that much while you're on antibiotics.Where people don't know, antibiotics wreck your cardio.Just wreck your physical strength, wreck your vitality.I got staff once and I remember it took antibiotics and I don't think I'd ever taken antibiotics [1:03:00] before while I was training.And when I was recovering from staff, I was like like this is nuts.I feel like I'm 50%.You're at 50%.Like when Luke Rock called beat Chris Wydeman he was on antibiotics.I mean I've taken a lot during matches.I've taken a lot I've been on it all the time.You know lost to matches.You're talking Rex you though right?Yeah I'd bad stuff in my leg like even during that Phillip Brod match.I remember I submitted him and then he had stuff a few days later, I was like, cut you to aesmate.But that was bad when the ductile had to cut that open and like squeeze it out, that was horrible.But I think the more you take anybody to less affect they have on you.So now I get stuff, shower straight off to it.Just regular soap?Right, yeah, I think we have some branded soap in there, but like I think it's just important.Like I mean, we're doing with some people that don't even have a shower.That's crazy.Yeah, someone that I have a quick rinse get out of there.I would see guys do that when they would just go home sweaty.I'm like, you're out of your fucking mind.Like, you're allowing that stuff to breed on your skin.While you're in your car, it's hot out.[1:04:08] That was Puerto Rico.We had no showers at the gym.Oh, God.So we'd have a 60 minute drive home off to each class without having a shower.Oh, that's insane.Look over the car, Fabric smell.But was the Puerto Rico gym, wasn't that exposed to sunlight at least?Wasn't the mat exposed to sunlight?Not enough, but you know what?Cause I get in the ocean every day, I think maybe that helped a lot.Oh, that probably helps a lot.A lot of sunshine down there too.Yeah, that probably helps a lot.Sunlight on the mats apparently is a great thing.Like if you could open up garage doors and have sunlight on the mats, apparently that kills a lot of things.Yeah, for sure.I also think sometimes like the overtrain.Like your immune system's just down because maybe you're stressed for sleeping.Yeah for sure.You're really stressed about a match.A lot of people get stuff right on a match because they push the training up.You do the anxiety of the match.They're thinking about it misses with their sleep and then they're just vulnerable to it.When you were training, did you ever monitor your heart rate, check your heart rate in the morning, make sure you're not overtraining.You know what I thought about doing that, [1:05:06] stuff to H-I-V stuff.That's what I thought about.I looked up one of the machines at the time and I was like, fuck, that's expensive, eh?I mean, now I don't want to do anything.I get my blood pressure checked, it's concerning, you know?I almost failed the last two medicals because the Possumance digits.It's not a man.Why would your blood pressure be so high?Good question.I probably too much caffeine Think that's it.I don't know.We should find out but I'm busy traveling all the time.I should look into it.You don't know what's wrong No, freak me out my blood pressure was high now you're freaking me out We'll test it out I mean, I just feel like I've got a survive for for this shit.I understand, but you're relying on your body.That's your business.Your business is your body.I just thought it's a faulty test.You know what I'm like?Faulty test for blood pressure?I think those things are 100%.I'm like, the boss have still there, get a bigger bitch.I don't think they're ever wrong with blood pressure.I was making jokes with the doctor last time I competed in Dubai and I was making jokes [1:06:08] with him and he was just like not laughing at all.He's like not having it a day.The Mexican doctor for Cradi come by, loved it, but not the Dubai guy.Oh, that's funny.I faced that.You know the guy in the UFC that finished Kevin Lee real quick?He knocked him down, the knocked him down, guillotine them in a minute.Oh the last guy.Yeah, his last fight.I was the last name.Renat.Renat.Look how remember his name.Right.He was crazy though, man.He did not want to tap.Adam Buggetrag put him in a triangle.He went to say that.There it is.Renat, how to say that?Fuck a red-off.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.[1:07:00] Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck the the the the way in when I have to do the way in did they get angry with you does anyone know no luckily no one's got an angry at me but it's always a mistake I fucked up a few times it's hard those words are sometimes your mouth just doesn't work right you know it just doesn't come out right I fucked up Umar Nermagomedov's name once when I was after his fight I was like god damn it yeah it just came out like remember I, I got it in sight now.It's hard.Some of them, Zabit was the hardest.Magomed Sharapov.Zabit Magomed Sharapov.That was the guy that I've been fuck, man.I was just really bummed out when he stepped out, when he just decided enough's enough.I think he's a doctor now.Really?I think so.Find out what he's doing.He's a beat Magomed Sharapov.That guy was fucking good man.He did some cool shit.Ooh, he did some wild shit.He was so interesting because he was from Dagestan but he fought like a, you know, like almost like a karate fighter.Yeah, crazy kicks.Yeah, wild kicks man and he could do anything.I mean, crazy trips too.He would do that trip.Oh yeah, [1:08:06] that he sort of led the way with that.Now, folks does a lot of guys try to do that one.Yeah, he was very good at that one particular trip.He's just so clever.So clever and creative and such an interesting fighter to watch.I was a bummed out man like really bummed out when that guy retired.I was like, shit.That's why I love traveling around finding these guys like these mysterious guys like I was in Japan I could have dinner with Gankie Suda.I love that dude.That's the coolest guy ever.Gankie Suda was like a politician now And then he's done it.Oh remember when you used to carry around that flag with all the all the we are all I'm we are all one.What a beautiful guy.So cool man.Like when a fight and then hold this up like we are all one.And then he just retired to pursue becoming a pop star and now he's a politician.He was a pop star?Yeah he owns restaurants.Yeah.Have you seen his dancing videos?No.What's a cool one?Imagine a guy who fights that could probably dance like a motherfucker.[1:09:00] Crazy dancing.G Daisy Dancing, Gengkisudo 1, I forget the name of a crate.Like dancing montage singing does it all.No shit.Wow.I'm not surprised.He's a creative guy.He was creative as a fighter too.Very interesting fighter to watch.He retired and like, he became a pop star to grow in popularity.Like even fighting wasn't his focus.He just wanted to leverage fighting and becoming a pop star to help him get into politics to help people.He really just wants to help people.So those were side gigs to get him to wear his today where he can use his political influence to help people in Japan.Wow.That is amazing.Does he look at him?Is this him dancing?Oh yeah.I guess get first pitch with all his dudes behind them.Oh, a terrible pitch.Yeah, software.Wow.That's pretty cool.He had some crazy, man.He back in that West Side grappling tournament, he liked was hitting some moves back then.[1:10:00] Oh, yeah, man.Innovative today.Yeah, wild, explosive, interesting guy.Just very interesting.I mean, that's the kind of thing about the sport that's so cool is that you get these human beings that are just exceptional human beings that decide to challenge themselves.And one of the most difficult things a person can do.Just like Volcanoesky, like you do a very interesting guy.Because like it takes extreme character and will and discipline to become Alexander Volkhenowski the greatest featherweight of all time.I mean it takes a lot to be that person.And you learn a lot just by being around those people.You learn about human potential.I mean I even learn grappling from these guys.You know people think I show up and I'm just helping them.Those guys are so talented.Like I still shit from them as well.You know just people think I show up and I'm just helping them.Like, those guys are so talented.Like, I still shit from them as well.You know, just, I don't know how they do it.Oh, Vox does it all.But if you learn from Vox.I mean, just the way, like, I really still a lot from MMA fighters and how they turtle and get up from that.Mm.A lot of rappers keeps getting up and they like what is happening?Like Derek Lewis?Yeah, they just get up.I love that.[1:11:05] I stole that for an instructioner name, just stand up.And I was like, Derek Lewis inspired.No, you did do that, right?You did make a whole instructional about getting up.Yeah.Is it because some guys get just too captured with the idea of engaging and grappling and not getting up?Yeah, well well like if a guy gets his Godpastage, you just look to get God back, whereas sometimes it's good to expose your back and just stand up and reset.Whereas like a lot of you just took guys are so scared to expose their back, they refuse to ever do it.So it's like when an MMA guy does it, they don't know how to deal with it.And it's good at dealing with it.It's interesting.Interesting.Yeah.Because you don't think about it.Yeah.Well, it's always like when you have new variables, new variables, new variables into any sort of fighting discipline.Like, oh, this is a new thing that I didn't consider.Yeah, I love that.That's why I love that.You just can be more complicated.MMA is a bit more simple.So it's like, [1:12:02] we can make all these instructions and you did so about all these weird positions like octopus, garden stuff, because you can be endlessly creative, right?And MMA, the consequences are so strong.Right.Right.It's a much simpler game.It doesn't mean it's easier.There's just less things you can do.Well, that's what's interesting is that guys in MMA in general aren't as good at submissions because they have all these other disciplines to consider.It's like when I went from Taikwondo to kickboxing, one of the things that I realized, oh, when people are punching you in the face, there's a lot of stuff you can't do.But if people aren't punching you in the face, damn you get good at kicking.And so these guys who are used to getting punched in the face, there's stuff that they don't have the dexterity, they don't have the ability to do, and I don't know if you develop that, to the same extent.Like when you see guys like Wonder Boy, who started out with Karate, like that guy can do stuff with his legs that the average person can't do, you know, or Yaya, Yaya Rodriguez.[1:13:02] This one's crazy.Oh my god, that guy.He's on my favorite guy's to watch, because this fucking kicks are crazy.They just come from everywhere.Who's he fighting next?That's a good question.Did he just fight?Was Otagra's last fight?I believe was that his last fight?Let's say it pull up, yeah, yeah, Rodriguez.But was just fine at what yaya yaya Rodriguez's next fight is.I don't know if they've announced it.I haven't heard anything.Yeah, it's funny when you're in the, when you, friends with a bunch of them, they fight it sometimes they let you know they'll fight.It's not been announced.You'll have fuck up, I'd better not say.Right.Better not drop the news, get in trouble.Yeah, that happens all the time.Yeah, I fuck up Nothing booked.Was it a Tiger's last one?Yes.Yeah.So he lost our Tiger.And before that Volcanowski, Volcanowski beat his ass.That was a prime Volcanowski display.Yeah, that was crazy.That man, yeah, he's just, he's just so strong.[1:14:02] He's like a maller.Yeah, muscle in the clinch.And we worked on a bunch of stuff because of how dangerous your A is guard is.Like he's got a dangerous guard and we had to overcome the fact that like, if you leave space against him, he throws elbows that cut you.So we had to navigate those areas and really it was good.Like a training box for a guy like, yeah, he is awesome because when he's on bottom there's like a big contingent of Mexican MMA fighters have really dangerous guards.Diego Lopez trains out, I think he's from Manaus originally but he trains a bunch of guys there and just aggressive bottom game where if you leave space sectoral bows and if you're close they're trying to set up high guards and submissions so it's like we really had to prepare for how dangerous he is there.He's one of the front runners in my opinion Diego look first of all how the fuck does that guy make 145?Shredded yet.He's just new.Everyone.Hey, he's so dangerous man.You know who do you fight super sedic?You said you stopped him in the first round?Yeah, but before that fight I was telling everybody I was like I think this guy's the guy.I think he's the next guy to emerge.[1:15:06] I wonder who he's booked against.I remember his first fight was like short notice against Mozvar.Yeah, he was.I thought he won.It was very close and Mozvar is undefeated in one of the best guys in the division.But Diego's scary.It's not just that he's good, he's fucking scary.He's intense.From every guy, like submissions, not getting.Submissions, knockouts, and his fucking standup is horrific.Yeah, yeah, you're just climb out Everest.Jesus Christ, yeah, you're.That's the most recent thing I could stop.Fucking relax, bro.He's so tough.He doesn't even look like he's fucking wearing anything.He's got warm.He's got bed watching.Look at he's got a fucking giant pack on, walking around, rocking.That's a good way to develop some cardio.I'll tell you that.It looks fine, but I definitely want someone else to hold the bag, hey.No, that's how you get the cardio.You have to carry the bag on your back.That's all I do.He can't.He can't.Looks fun.I hope you have the mountain, those guys.Yeah, the Sherpas, yeah, but I think he's trying to get fit.[1:16:06] I think that's the whole idea.But I think it's interesting when a guy like that is just so good at one area, which is kicking and very good off his back submission, but then struggles in a couple other areas.He's almost there.He's like right there at the tipi top, but not quite at the level of the guys that are beating him.Just, but like remember when he lost to Frankie, came back from that and just become a much better fighter, much better fighter.Just people can't even out a couple of times.He almost reinvented himself, like surprised people, you know?That happens so often.Like people counted out Max Holloway.You know, Max Holloway, the last fight with Volk, Volk dominated and Max just said, hey, that was his night.He had a great night.And that is a fact of fighting too.Like sometimes a guy will clip you in the first round and you're kind of not the same.And he, but if you didn't clip you, maybe you would have won.Like maybe, you know, maybe if you like, just engage, you max all the way, gets caught with that jump spinning back kick to the nose [1:17:06] at the end of the first try.Shattered his nose.That's a big factor.Big factor.Doesn't land that.Who knows?Fight was a fucking amazing fight still, even with that shattered nose.Crazy.I was watching that.I was into bio-affercurity combat and I was watching staff at the buffet at the hotel.I was like, everyone will go on crazy.I'll put the laptop down, eat normal, and we're gonna have to ask the fucking craziest fight ever.It was the craziest fight ever.And the last 10 seconds when Max points to the floor, a fight that he's winning four rounds to one, crazy to just call the guy out.We're gonna do that in jiu-jitsu, like give each other a leg, let's fucking go.I don't think that's the same.We just both get broken.Well that's an interesting thing about the EBI rules.How do you like those rules?The rules where, when it goes to overtime, you start either on a person's back or you start from what they call spiderweb, which is psychotrolic, trying to get an arm.I mean, I like anything creative like that that's gonna force people to train those different areas.But the majority of the sport, [1:18:06] especially old school guys don't like it, it's very difficult to get them to compete under those roles.Me personally, I like any role set I can be the guy in.So I had Philippe Penematch and the USC Fire Pass guys were like, oh, what role set should we do?And I was like, I think rules have strategically Against particular opponents, but you know like I like Kyle Bams have planted guy one of the best over tongue guys in the world Like if if I had a match with him I'd be like, huh?We'll just do a regular rules match, you know, right?So like it's it's sort of strategy base Right based on the opponent's strengths like even Niki wrote against Gordon like they went to OT Mm-hmm, and it was fucking close, you know, and it's like that is very stressful.It's exciting.It's exciting.But if guys get submitted in those areas, sometimes people don't consider it real even though it is, you know, they're like lots of overtime victory.You didn't really submit it, but you did.Right.When Nikki grabbed that foot.Yeah, just fucking ripped that eye.I mean, how bad is his leg fucked up still?[1:19:06] You gotta think like that's doing some damage.I just think like what was hilarious about that is like he was meant, got his meant to face Vinnie Magalesh and no disrespect to Vinnie Vittys just had a later stage of his career, right?Vinnie when he was young was a monster.It was incredible.And then it's like two days before they flipped the script and you got Niki wrote.And you know what I mean?And I just can just pitch a him just getting his foot broken, being like, what the fuck are you?What the fuck just happened?You know?When I watched it, I was like, Jesus Christ, that is a lot of Niki is such a gorilla.It was loud.It was loud.You heard this now, Bay.Sometimes though you get popped and it's so fast that it's the damage is already done and you're just like, well it's already injured, let's keep it on, you know?Right.But it's not obviously some of the submissions are holding tension points slowly breaking, but the ones that are quick.Sometimes guys don't tap because it's like you didn't even have time to process it.Well, what about the one with you and Vinny?Where you broke his leg.That was disgusting.Yeah, that still hones me.[1:20:05] Hey, but yeah, I don't know what he did.How the fuck did he keep going?Why did he keep going?But that's just, you gotta be careful what shit talk he say.Like, I try to be careful with what I say.I'm never gonna be like leg locks don't work.Cause he got put in a leg lock in 20 seconds and it's like, now you committed to the bit, you know?Was he saying leg locks don't work?Yeah, his leg locks don't work.And then his leg exploded, and I'm like, that's such a crazy thing to say, leg locks don't work.It's because he had matches with Gary and Gordon, and they got some pops on him, but he hadn't submitted.So maybe they laid the groundwork for me, but I think it spiro fracture of his fibula.Oh, he's got ankle, yeah, disturbing.Oh.That was where I was like, well, I wouldn't let that happen for a million.I don't know how much child sun and pain you even, it must be more than me.I just think it's as pride, you know, just didn't want to out.Yeah, the fact that he kept going after the leg snapped, that was loud.[1:21:02] That was, yeah, that was that.That was yeah that was that and the second one I saw the bone poking into the skin like if I'd kept going it would have probably like he's whatever bone fragment.I would have come out yeah.I was nervous I was like bro just gotta wait for over time like you just didn't want to tap but then the ref caught it because his leg was dangling.I did it I was the first who hooked and then the second one I baited him where I pretend like I was going for his other leg so he gave me the bad one again but He was laughing as he was like fuck I couldn't have you broke break both my legs That's my multi-part.Oh My god, so you knew it was already broken you well he so My foot hit the ground at the exact second his leg snapped enough So for a second like I felt a little bit of crunching, but I didn't hear it.Everyone else in the room heard it.And then he gets out of it and I was just like, well, this is fucking guys flexible way.And then he says to me, he goes, I think he broke my leg.Oh, no, he said it in the [1:22:01] middle of the man.Yeah, we stopped talking and I'm just like, what's happening here?Right, how strange.And I was like, well, you want to keep going?All right.And he gave, like I ended up back with the same leg.Oh, good.And it was just no resistance.His ankle just did a full, just kept on.See if you can find that, Jamie.That's this light right away?You making me do this.Yeah, very pleased tap.You give him a trauma.I remember watching it with this look on my face.Oh, don't fucking.I just felt bad for him, cause he's a fucking good guy.And I was just like, man, did you not tap cause you Honestly, I don't know, but he came back and competed against Mason Fowler like maybe four, five months later.That's crazy.And it's just like, you're getting some mileage on the body there bro, it's like, yeah, is it worth it?I mean, better than the Tibia, I guess.[1:23:02] The fibula, I cracked my fibula before.It's not as bad, it's a small bone.You know, and they can just let it fix.You know, let it heal up once they screw it together.Oh, and let it break, I'm like, uh-oh.It's a truck, yeah.The noise is bad.I've broken a few legs and I'm just like, right.So here it is.Is this before?The's the first ones with the brakes at the start of match.So he's legs already broken here.So you go to like 20 seconds.Yeah, that right there.So we hit like a 50-50 in there, and you hear it.You might wanna hear that knee down and pull this leg out.See, he's actually in a little bit deep.Ah!Oh, dude!Yeah, so look at this.Oh dude, you hear it.Look at his foot.Look where his foot is.And then he tries to get me.Oh my.I let go of it because I was like.I do not know how he got out of the hotel.He can't let his leg break and then me just out.For the rubber guard, I guess we got rubber knee.[1:24:01] He's huge here too.That was one of Craig's best positions and he got to it with it.Dude, the sound is so awful.The sound of broken bones, I've never, I've never get it like Chris Wideman when he fought Uriah Hall.Oh, that's nice.It was like full power and Uriah checked it and he's seen snap.He hear the snap and he sees his leg bend over like, oh.that's where it's like, it's crazy how people react to that shit where Conor McGregor is still just talking shit.That's fucking hilarious to me.I'm just like, he's such a psychopath.He never missed a moment.He didn't even have the pain killing whistle yet, but he was ready for some shit again.Did you see him partying like a night or two ago?You reckon real?I mean, it doesn't mean he's drinking.He's vibing.He's having his wife.He's got a shirt off because he's having a good time.I mean, it looked like he wasn't sober, but he could just be a fucking maniac.It's wine games though, maybe.It could be that.Yeah.That's why I do with Lovato.I was kept talking about [1:25:00] how his potty know the time and I was, But I was like, maybe it's gonna mess with, you know what I mean?Right, right, right.Here's Connor, and he's kissing his wife.He's throwing, he took a shirt off.He's getting crazy.But I mean, he could just be enthusiastic.I don't know.I don't know.It looks a little fucked up.Listen, I saw a roadhouse, you ain't that good actor.No.Shane Gillis has an amazing bit about roadhouse.You have to see it.Oh really?It's so fucking funny.He's a legend day.I want to get him involved in this.I want to get some comedians coming to him, just shit talking, the grappling gloves, you know?Oh, that's funny.And hilarious.We'd have who know some grappling.Joey Diaz.Joey Diaz would be amazing.Surprising if he's on paper, I'd be thinking of be fucking...Oh, he wouldn't do interviews, I don't think.He wouldn't be good at that, but he'd be good at, like, commentary.Get him in the booth.Yeah, just get him talking shit.Yeah.I'll get people's names up.I'll get him to corner me against Gabby.He might do it.You never know.I ordered hegan in the Alba Dhabi.Oh, you did 2003.He didn't have anybody with him.Oh, it's a Joe Hogan [1:26:08] He said you think that just tell me when the time because like hegan, you know, had been training that much Wasn't the best of shape just let me know what time it was just yelling out with the time as yeah That's what I say sometimes I was about to have a like if I'm the slide.let me know the time yeah let me know if you think I'm burning too much gas or I'm too relaxed and I'm like that's that's the key here right right haven't Joey Diaz in your corner would be fucking hysterical Alex Jones won't do it but I'm like oh that's a tough guy to get involved with the charities yeah foundation with my business partner Seth our foundation is called the Fair Fight Foundation and I'm just like it's probably not good to start it with fighting a woman, but it's a bold man.Well, it's a fair fight though, she's so big.I mean, she might not weigh you by, what do you walk around at?205, she got a few pounds for me for sure.At least 40.Last night, we were video calling each other and we were both taking Aniv I popped a 50 and she popped a 25 us that you need both not to be me pussy [1:27:12] Like took some screenshots hey, I don't know if I'll release that's hilarious.I'm yeah, I should talk I should talk to get the contracts on you know, you should have joy deas do commentary for that fight That would be the perfect fight for him to do commentary for yeah, just comment Yeah, cuz Joey does do just two.He knows a little bit.He definitely knows positions and he talks so much shit.He's just so hilarious.I'm gonna take it serious, but I am gonna come out in a what tank top smug and a cigarette probably, you know?I'll put it on the corner of the mat and see if I'm gonna finish it before it finishes, you know?Ah Wow.Yeah, well having something like that would definitely be an added element of fun some fun the tournament Sirius obviously guys are going to kill each other and then a bit of a bit of entertainment, you know a bit of a Battle of the sexes I guess you could say Definitely that sort of A battle of the enhanced sexes [1:28:03] Yeah, who's more enhanced though?Yeah, she is.Yeah, for sure.I got to know her stack.I wish what I wanted to do was run an event where we drug tested, but it was anonymous.And just for my own personal enjoyment, I just find out.I want to see who's the levels are.Who took the most of anything, you know?Right.See if there's any hollow testing in there or something?It would be fun to see, like, because Jiu-Jitsu is an open steroid using event.Have you heard of the enhanced games?Oh, yeah, yeah.I was reading about that.I'm having those guys on.So the enhanced games is this, they're going to allow all the athletes to take performance enhancing drugs.And the idea is like, we should have athletes perform to the best way, I mean, I'm putting words in their mouth, but that's scientifically possible.And the best way scientifically possible is like, like here's a, for instance, like this Ryan Garcia fight, you know, Ryan Garcia, he beats Devin Haney, spectacular fashion, looks amazing, pops for Austrian, very low doses of Austrian, which are not going to affect him in terms of performance [1:29:07] enhancing ability during the fight itself.I don't know how we took it or what he took it.I know people have got an Osterine accident like Shogoshan O'Malley got it through tainted supplements.They proved it.It's more than once that's happened.Yo-L.Yeah, I sued.Yo-L.Yeah.He won.Yeah, which is, if you would think anybody would not be fucking natural, that guy.How does he still look like he does?He's the Cuban fucking athlete program.That's how.He's grappling.He's taking a grappling match in Britain against a grappler, Owen Livecy.So we'll see if we have a grappling takes it it's a good question to very good question anything you know i was one of the very best cuban wrestlers ever mean he's a fucking tank yes so what silver medal at the limps at a site that they're right yeah yeah i mean he's a monster man and and physically he's just such an imposing force [1:30:02] like luke rock hold said that it hurt and what would a Robert Whitaker said the same thing He said it hurts when you hit him So he's made out of metal probably hurts when he kisses you as well every knocks you out.Yeah, that was rough That's a rough way to go.Well, you know Luke likes to talk shit and you talk shit to that guy.I know you I like he did this also dancing for the press conference was the best too, picking women out of the crowd.You wanted to take your misses, you'd be like, fuck it and sit back down.I know, exactly.That guy's such a fucking animal.I mean, I really wish he got into MMA earlier in his career.It would have been amazing to see because I think when he entered the UFC, he was in his late 30s.Yeah, how?He's like, he's up in now.He's 46 now.He still looks amazing.That's Randy Ketu.Yeah, but like he doesn't look 46.Like Randy looked like a strong 46 year old.I need that human stack.Yeah, what his stack is not, I mean, I've told this story before for people who have heard it.I'm sorry, but one of the things that happened to Yoel when he got injured, he fought in the UFC and then they brought him to a doctor.He had an orbital fracture and [1:31:06] Some other issues they brought him to the doctor and the doctor said to the UFC said where did you get this guy?And they and he's like yeah, he's amazing right?He goes no you understand it because I've never seen a human being like this before the tendons in his eyes are Three times larger than a normal person.He said his orbital bow and his already healing So this guy's a freak how do I get to that level?three times larger than a normal person.He said his orbital bow and his already healing.So this guy's a freak.How do I get to that level?I think you gotta be born in Cuba.And that's the genetics I'm messing around.And the shitty convicts genetics from Australia.What?I think it's, I just wonder what they do in Cuba for their athletes.Do you know what I'm saying?I mean, without casting any aspersions in terms of performance enhancing supplements.Does anyone want me to find out?Yeah.Go there.Ask them.I don't know.I don't know what they did.But I mean, the guy's like Wolverine.But he's also a genetic specimen.I mean, there's only so much you could do with steroids.I mean, that guy...[1:32:01] I know.I've tried.You don't even live weights, which is so crazy.You're taking steroids without lifting weights.From time to time, you know, just a good lifting program.If you pull up here and there.Yeah, I don't think steroids are going to help you recover and train.Yeah, it definitely helped your well-being, I think.Yeah.Well, if you're training 365, that's the argument, right?If you're training 365 days a year, that's also the argument for like, Tour de France.You know, I've heard it argued from people that really, or experts that you're actually healthier to take steroids and perform sedancing drugs to do Tour de France, then you are without it.Because your body just can't recover without it.It's just so grueling, it's such a brutal race.It's a reason why so many of them are blood doping, so many of them are taking EPO into testosterone.I always wanted to try EPO.Actually, like, some people criticize me for saying I take steroids in YouTube, but the way I look at it is the kids, the next generation, they're gonna take it anyway.I at least wanna put out my exact stack and I just wanna send it out as almost like, [1:33:07] it's like drugs, just say no, doesn't work.It's like, I wanna let them know I'm taking a safe amount of deducted guidance and that it's not a mystery where they think in like I have to take one gram a week and all this stuff to compete at a high level.So it's like a middle ground.Obviously get criticized for it, but it's like the other option is they don't know what a high-level athlete's second and they fucking ruin their body taking crazy dosages.Well, it would be interesting, like, what would Jiu Jitsu look like if steroids weren't legal?I mean, one of the things we found out when you saw it came into the UFC, even though there was previous drug testing, it was really only during the weigh-ins.Which is kind of just an intelligence test.It's all it is.When you look at Alster over him versus Brock Lesnar, the idea that either one of those motherfuckers is clean is crazy talk.That's crazy talk, especially Alster.Alster was, he fought, when he fought 205, when he fought, like back when he fought Chuck LaDelle, 205, and then look at him at 265.He gained 60 pounds and he looks like a fucking superhero.[1:34:07] Uber him, like those days, like when he won the K1 Grand Prix and when he won the beat rock, I had a heart and stuff.Oh my God.I love it when they said the old days what that was an intelligence test because many guys still failed that intelligence test.Well you know what it is?You know how it is, Like you're in gyms, you have gym bros that are coaching you.They don't really know what the fuck they're talking about, but they say a lot of good big words.And you go, I know that I was out of the past to test.And you rely on these meat heads to try to pass the test.You need a big to con day on the line.Well, there's people that have everyone's clean.I think there's probably some really, there's so much money involved in MMA now.There's probably some really sophisticated scientists that are working with elite athletes and they're developing protocols that are either undetectable or they have a short lasting, [1:35:01] which is probably why you saw it wakes you up at six o'clock in the morning.The know, the idea is like to catch you while it's still in your system.If you have short acting stuff that's...Yeah, look, a test propy and I do something like the water nice.Yeah.Like, weren't they doing that in baseball?They were taking like testosterone gummies and the idea is that they metabolize so quickly that you get their effect of them, but then they're out of your system by the time you get tested.I tried those, it tasted like shit, you know?Well, I don't know if they didn't think, but I mean, it's fucking gummy with testosterone and how could it taste good?Throw it out of the tongue.What is a daze like?Just bad, hey.Like chemical?Yeah, like it's just there a while.I remember I was trying to get legal steroids in Australia when I was coming up And I just couldn't do it.They just my doctor gave me the testosterone coming so I was like fuck this shit It's like I felt like I wouldn't work in Australia was what are the laws like?I mean here any I think any GP can prescribe testoster in Australia You have to be like an endocrinologist.They they added a layer to it and there it's hard to [1:36:05] To see an endocrinologist.It's gonna give testosterone to a young healthy dude.Guys back there would do sort of crazy shit.They're not sleep for a couple days.They beat off a bunch of times trying to crash the levels.Go to the blood check.Dr.Zagato, your test is low.Yeah.Well, another thing, the problem with the test being low.This is what they found when they they did it they had testosterone use exemptions in the UFC for a brief amount of time Few years and those are the V-torbal for years, you know and the problem is When a guy's done steroids this whole life has ended consistent is fucked up already So you go in there and they test your testosterone level and you're like wow your levels are super low Like you need testosterone like thank you But the reason why they're low is because you've been on steroids your whole life.Yeah, your body doesn't make it anymore.Yeah, I mean, you went, you look at V-Tor from the early days, like V-Tor in UFC 12 when he fought Scott Farozo and Trey Telegmin, he weighed like 200 pounds.You know.They used to call him V-Tor Gracie you right there Victor Gracie.I was training at school.Why'd they throw the C in there?[1:37:06] I don't know it was okay.Okay Victor.Yeah, it was I don't know I don't understand it I don't know why they did that and I know that I think they were threatening to sue him if you use the Gracie name I think Someone's detective of that shit.Yes.I think it was Orion.Orion was very Representing oning that.Yeah, would you get that?Some brand sanits me.I like it.Though it's dope shirt.I should remember the name.He was the fucking man, huh?What's its name?The shirt company?I feel bad for him.Oh, fuck it.People find it.Is it on the back?Anywhere?A little label?Can't say anything.Let's see a tag.Label us.What is it saying the bottom?What was it there?Is that the name?What do we got?What does the bottom say there?OG says Hiction.Hiction.Oh man, I feel bad for him.By the cool shot, onerin the OG.Yeah, it's pretty dope.He is the OG.He was the fucking man.Cool motherfucker.Yeah.Do you ever train with him?I've never tried with him.Never met him.Really?Interesting dude, man.Very [1:38:09] interesting dude.I got a chance to watch Colosseum.Remember when he fought Funaki?Was that his last one?Yes.Yeah.I got a chance to watch a footage of that with him in his house.Oh, the guy came to the gym, right?Was it the gym challenge?No, I didn't watch that.He didn't show me that.Someone's gonna have that.He's got it.We gotta get that.I know, I'm like, release that, bro.Why don't you release that?That was Yoji Angel, right?Yeah, yeah, he came to the challenge restaurant.He just beat the fuck out of them.And he goes, yeah.And he's like, if we are competing, when your tab is over, if we're fighting, when I'm done, I'm done.I decide.You just beat the fuck out of that dude.That's some scary shit.I feel sad for me and I go, Parkinson's, right?Who does?I believe Hicks and Dust.Does it really?[1:39:00] I believe so.No kidding.I didn't hear that.Yeah, I saw a cure, a greasy announcement something about it.See, I always wonder, because we talked about Freddie Roach.Like, that's trauma-induced Parkinson's.And, you know, Hickson didn't get hit a whole lot in his career, but he did get hit.You know, I always wonder.Yeah.Hickson graced you fight against Parkinson's.I'm not scared of death, but quitting is unacceptable.Rolling Stone magazine?Whoa!This is Rolling Stone?That's crazy.That is crazy that there's a Hicks and Gracie article in Rolling Stone.That's amazing.Wow.Fuck, man, Parkinson's.I hope we get a chronback.I hope so too.You might come back to grappling maybe.Well, I mean, his last fight in MMA just looked like he was just trying to pull guard and work off his back and it's just he just didn't look like he's prepared.I don't know a place he could do that.[1:40:01] Yeah.Do you think he would be willing to be?I mean, he was such an elite grappler.The Gary Tonin match.What a fucking match.That was holy shit, man.Crazy as shit ever.That was before Gary was training with the Donner or Desquad, right?Wasn't it?I mean, good question.If we saw the match, we'd see he was in the corner because there's definitely before the leg lock days.Yeah.This was a long time, Gary was dominating that fight until the very end.Back in those days was crazy.I still miss Eddie Cummings.I'm like, what happened to him?You know what I mean?Right, what did happen to him?That guy was good.I've tried to catch up with him a couple times in New York, like reach down.I I just want to have lunch with the guy I'm like, but he's like, he just left the grappling well, disbandaged.What is he doing?No, I don't think anyone knows.He came back, I saw you in a couple videos, he came back to Hanzo's and trained a couple times, but I think he doesn't like any meteor attention and like it's so cool to round on Instagram and he just vanished again.Really?Yeah.So crazy He was on a elite grappler too.Well, he was one of the very best of the leglock guys in the early days [1:41:06] He was scary.We'll copy him.He was scary scary.Did Super smart like a really intelligent guy and now yeah, he ended up with a Tavi of Odain, right?Mm-hmm Yeah, they started dating when she started training at at Hanzo's and I don't know what happened She can be I think she could be doing grappling a lot as well.Yeah, she had fucked up knees, man.Her knees were all blown out.I remember trying to tell her to get surgery.To fix him off.Eddie kept bragging, and brother not.I don't know, but she really, I think she had at least one with no ACL.Where that's crazy, yeah.Doesn't Nikki ever fucked up, Ne?Nikki Ryan?Nikki Ryan does.Man, Nikki Ryan gets injured every three minutes.You know what I mean?He's made a glass unfortunately.I came back trying within one round, injured him the other day.I'm just like, fuck, what, how does this happen?I felt bad.It's a bit of a weird scramble, but he just beat JT Taurus the like biggest win of his career.Yeah, he looked great in that.That was beautiful.Yeah, he was trying to real serious for that But doesn't he have like one ACL that's gone?Yeah, yeah, I remember [1:42:09] He tore his ACL and the doctors were like hey, we're gonna tempt surgery or you can do rehab only So he just did nothing and just kept training He didn't even rehab the thing I'm like bro do something.Yeah, he's wild That's not wise for the future though.No, I know.I mean, I think he had 95% of his meniscus removed in one of his legs.Oh, God damn it.Yeah, I'm pretty sure one surgeon was like, I want to do that.You're too young for it, buddy.Got it done.Well, you know, they do meniscus replacements.Oh, they do that.Yes, they do cadaver meniscus replacements, especially with young people, it's really effective.He's got some mileage in the body, so it's like his knees.God, I hope he does it.Because he can do it and it'll actually take.We got him in this, though.He's going after the million.Better be exciting.What a fucked up knee.There's always something fucked up with him, you know?[1:43:00] He's always injured in some way.Well, isn't that the case with so many elite combat sports athletes?It's very rare.Other than boxers, it's very rare.There's a story going around about this NBA player who got a menistka's from a donor.Is that mean it's a cadaver or was?Because they don't say cadaver at all in this.No, that's what they mean.They mean a donor.Yeah, I said, it's effective.It's possible.For I think there's an age where they don't recommend it anymore because of the lack of blood circulation.But I always wonder for who though, like when they say you know you can't do it after 40.But for who?Like for the regular person who is a 40-year-old, who doesn't work out and is not physically fit, or if you did that to say someone like Steve Amy Ochoch, could he get a meniscus replacement when he's constantly training?And how much does your age affect blood flow to that area?[1:44:04] What is the factor?It doesn't make sense.If you still have a great VO2 max, you're still very fit in your super healthy train all the time, you obviously have great circulation.Like I don't understand why at a certain age, they wouldn't recommend it.I wonder if it's based on averages.Like you take the average 50 year old guy and you give it to him and his knees still fucked up because his body didn't heal properly.But like with peptides, with all the things that are available today and stem cells, I wonder.Yeah, it's gonna be some things you do to stack the deck and you get favor for that fish.So once you remove your meniscus, I have a meniscus was scoped on my left knee and it's always gonna be fucked up There's always like something.Yeah, it's just grinding right well, it's it's not all of mine is gone It's only in a corner But I I suffered a what's called a insufficiency fracture where you're Because there's no meniscus I crash skiing and I cracked my bones together so hard, [1:45:06] that it cracked the top of my shin bone.Skating scares me.It's the snowboarding scene.That was my last time skiing.I got a concussion, I fucking bang my head off the ground, real hard.And I was skiing around this corner and this lady didn't know what she was doing.And she was like, Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr So I chose falling down and I fucking bang my head so hard.As my head banged, I'm like, oh, that one counts.I was like, that's a real hard.No, it would have been bad.It would have been bad because she wasn't very large and I was, No, Gabby, I wasn't going slow.I want to see her on the slopes.It would have been, yeah, bro, that's like a bowling ball.[1:46:03] Just fucking flying down the hill.I mean, all that weight, the momentum of all that weight.I imagine when you're really big, like my kids ski and they ski so easy, because they're light.And like, weee weee weee, but the heavier you are, like the more fucking momentum is coming down.Well, it's in the injury skiing side.Probably not.Yeah, my friend Shane Dorian, he blew his fucking knee out, snowboarding, he hit a tree, torched his knee, had to get it reconstructed and stem cells and all that jazz.He's good to go now, but it took a long time before it was good.And I was to imagine you're a professional, you're a professional surfer, one of the best in the world, big wave surfer.I mean, he's a fucking monster.Like, I would do everything to preserve my goddamn knees, but he loves snowboarding so much, he's still back at it.Like, you're insane, man.Yeah, that's crazy.That's crazy.You'd risk your career.Your career?Well, I think he's kind of, his career as a competition is kind of over.You know, he's just kind of a representative of a bunch of different brands.And I don't know if he competes.I mean, Kelly Slater still competes, which is crazy and still wins.[1:47:06] Kelly still trains, yeah.Yeah, still trains you get to.Yeah.Yeah.I suppose that's risky for yourself to go there too.Oh yeah, that's gotta be risky.It's gotta be risky for everything.Like I know guys who play musical instruments and they fucked up their hands and she just broke it up a finger.I'm like, yikes.You're like tattoo out of sedgings.It's like, maybe don't train.Yeah, I mean, if you break a hand, and that's the hand you play guitar with, and now you've got these fucking gnarly ass fingers, and you're still trying to move at the same speed.Yeah, I had some of my fingers.One time I got my thumb stuck up here in grappling, and another time, my finger got stuck on the ground and went straight up.I remember that.That was in Puerto Rico.All of the tas have broke my hand.And I went to the hospital in Puerto Rico.We go to the X-ray.I'm waiting around for hours.And the guys like, it's fun.No breaks, nothing.So I leave.And then I'm like, my hands fucked up.So I go back and end up getting the X-ray and I can see it's broken and I'll end up getting it treated.I just posted it on Instagram.I was like, any hand surgeons, what can I do for this?And we just spoke [1:48:09] about it on Instagram.What did he say to do?I just left it like this for a while.Didn't really.Didn't use it too much.So was it a fracture in the sense where they didn't have to bolt it together?Yeah, didn't have to.It's the same one when people punch a wolo something.Oh, okay.Like, yeah.The blind down here.So that one didn't need anything.But I mean, I just, I was, a lot of Puerto Rican stories like that where I was like, yeah, it's not broken.I can see it's broken.Not so good medicine over there?No, not at all.Yeah, no, that was a, that was a where I've gone to the doctor and they're like this is staff I need any products, but they don't want to be told Like by some fucking idiot that they're like diagnosing themselves giving themselves the treatment So they resisted I know resisted on you.Yeah, really I've had doctors not give me any what X and then it's going to Well, I tell you it's not stay there like now you're fine.Just put some cream on it boy.Oh [1:49:08] Boy, yeah, but I get it They probably have guys coming all the time to that block give me this give me this right But no one's coming in to get antibiotics for fun.Yeah, I mean that's not like painkillers.No, yeah, it's I guess I can control my bit, but yeah I just have to deal with like people coming in.Oh, my back.Yeah, my bag.Give me some xana I'm so much anxiety.I can't deal with people coming in.Oh, I hurt my back.Yeah, I'm not bad.Give me some xanax.Oh, I'm so much anxiety.I can't deal with this.They just freak out enough in the office.Maybe they'll give you something just to calm you down.That's a good play.Really depends on the doctor.Because some doctors are just a little loose with it.Yeah, sure.I feel like honestly, the more expensive the doctor, the better your chances.Oh yeah.Getting to what you want.Oh yeah, I would imagine.They probably have some sort of fucking deal too.Like, you know, my wife's mom was a nurse and she would explain to me how the whole pharmaceutical rep thing worked.And Brigham, Brigham from Wasteland, used to be a pharmaceutical rep.It's like, bro, like the relationship they have with doctors is like, it's so slippery.[1:50:05] I'll get them to prescribe.Yeah, it's so slippery because, you know, even if they're not paying you and they do pay people, but even if they're not, like, this is your friend.They show up, a, Brigham was like, I would show up with their kids softball games.I knew everybody's name.He'd become friendly.They want to prescribe your drugs.You're a good guy.That's wild.Yeah, it's fucking creepy.If I like us, the opioid epidemic and stuff like that, right?Oh, that's exactly it.Did you ever watch that Chopin killer on Netflix?I started by never finished it fucking lazy.Oh, it's so fucked up.How those people are not and jail is insane.Not only did they bullshit people and get people to prescribe these things, but they've ruined.Who knows how many lives?Hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions dead from opioid overdoses, and then the amount of lives that are destroyed [1:51:01] because of those things.Families wrecked everything.And they tricked people.They tricked them into doing drugs that are destroyed because of those things.Families wrecked everything.And they tricked people.They tricked them into doing drugs that are gonna be...They just paid a fine, right, massive fine.That's enough?Yeah, but not enough.It's also, they part of the fine was that they were gonna avoid prosecution.Like if they paid, you know, X amount of billions of dollars, they would avoid prosecution.But I think then pain killer came out, the documentary came out, the Netflix series.And then they kind of withheld that.And I think one of the guys who was the main guy for the FDA that was responsible for green lighting, um, oxycontin and oxCodone.That guy, they found him.He was at like in a small town in New Hampshire.He's hiding away.He was hiding.Yeah, I mean, they paid him off.And this fucker was out there roaming around and then they found him and- He's like Epstein's girlfriend, hey.Except she's in jail somewhere.Yeah, they got her eventually.[1:52:01] Yeah, eventually she's gonna get out and she's gonna fuck go swimming and drown or something Yeah, Jerry, Jerry.I mean that'll be me after this tournament.I can't I do worry about that.I Mean it should be alright That's not comforting should be alright.Yeah, I mean it's just a bit of friendly competition It is that but it's also like you're specifically going head to head.Like if you had done it a month earlier or a month later, I don't think we'd have the same issues.I don't think we'd have the same impact on the sport though.We do.I think you would.We'll do it a month after as well.Well, cool out my buddy.We need another million brother.Let's go on again.But you want to do it once a year, right?You don't want to do it more than once a year.Yeah, I'm on the phone, don't stop.Hey, talking to people about this event and stuff.Got to explain everyone the rules set.Yeah.And becoming a promoter.I mean, do you have to hire a staff now?Do you have to hire all these coordination and stuff, but me I'm just talking to the athletes coming up with the roles sort of [1:53:07] So he does all the coordination like hiring the staff making sure the event is well run Yeah, because I would imagine if you've never run an event before like that's obviously you can't call Abu Dhabi and ask for tips You call it I should you call it Bravo.Yeah, I spoke that him.He loves it.That's like.Yeah, you're very excited about it.Little hat tip to him with the name as well.Yeah, I think the having something where there's more money involved is always good.It's just like the timing of it.It's like when to do it.I just if you'd asked me out, I said, hmm, I still gotta watch the finals, you know?Well, yeah, true.They still gotta watch the finals.They get to watch the finals, but you won't have the same people competing, because if they're gonna compete on Friday and Saturday, that precludes them from being able to compete in Abu Dhabi.If I mean, yeah, for sure.Do you want to go Maddo in 10k or the million?Right.That's the argument.That is the argument argument, right?And it's it's certainly look competition is almost always good.It even [1:54:06] when people don't like it, it forces them to up their game.And I think at the end of the day, it's going to be good for the athletes and good for the sport because it'll make people more and the beef, the beef will, you know, too packed biggie with I'm going down in Vegas like two packed it.Remember how both of those guys guys died though by the way.They died very badly.Yeah.All two-pock and biggie.Like it would have been better if two-pock and biggie just kind of worked it out.Like, I mean, even like Drake and Kendrick, but that was entertaining.But Drake's house got shot at, you know, like someone did a security guard get shot.I think he got shot.Yeah.And then we got some good music.Sort, I didn't know.Security got to take the hit.I mean, yeah, yeah, someone, she's the songs are good.I just find it foolish.The bave, mm-hmm.I'm not beef guy.I feel like those guys could have wrote banging songs.They both put out four songs each, you know?It's like, he's that creativity and just, [1:55:04] yeah, I guess he would be driven.I mean I get it I get it it's part of the culture I get it don't get me wrong like I like roast battles.Yeah do comedy.They should have done that.Yeah.So the paper viewers that would have been amazing.Yeah that would have that would have been amazing.Yeah.Rap battles are awesome.It's just, you know, it's another opportunity to write.It's another opportunity to create something.And it's high pressure.Yeah.So in that sense, this rivalry between ADCC and the CJAI, you know?Just wanna Australian idiot, that's the city, you know?Let's see what I'm gonna say.Yeah, versus a monarchy.A monarchy, yeah.But I mean, I still love AddyCC's love of like history, you know, I think you can wash that away.It's amazing.Yeah.Um, do you think you could ever compete for them again?I think that's over now.I mean, I wouldn't do a 10k.I don't know.I mean, who knows?[1:56:00] I'm, I'm, The doors open for anything.I don't take any of this stuff too seriously at all.You know what I mean?A lot of us just find on the internet.Like I don't really, you know, like, fucking around having a good time, you know, like, I'll do anything for the right price.So it's like, if the spectacles there, if people are interested in it.Right, so you would go back if they would have you back.I won and what I wanted from day one was just athletes across everything in Gigi to be compensated just a little bit more You know because again, we don't have the prestige So if they had ramped it up from 10 to 20 You would have done this wouldn't it really wow Boy, they're probably going fuck.Oh, yeah, I just that's that's really What sort of kicked it off?But also I wanted to do like this is opportunity to start up out non-profit and stuff.So it's like gives me opportunity to get back in other ways.So with your this attitude about not taking things so seriously, do you think you and Gordon would ever bury the hatchet?I mean for sure, but it takes a man to the MA who gets the bottom of it, you know?I think he needs it, you know what I mean?Don't you think though that for a guy to be as dominant as he is, you have to be that [1:57:08] guy.That's like Michael Jordan in his prime.They said if you beat him in a game of pool, you wouldn't talk to you for like two weeks.You just have to be kind of a psycho.I know, but you see, I guess you see the contrast in some areas.Like, in my opinion, Volkanovsky was that, GSP was that.But really nice guys.Yeah, and the survival was out.Again, I don't think Gordon's, I mean, it's hard to say what he is, you know?It's like, it's hard, I don't know, I'm that well, you know?I know what the image he puts out.I know a little bit of the stuff behind the scenes, but.But you trained with him for years, you gotta know them.Yeah, but you know what you do to guys of life?You like, fuck, get on the mat, so I don't wanna hang out with them afterwards.Fucking, weed us.Who wants to have a conversation with a jujitsu guy?Me.That's why you're here.Some of them.Some of them.Fucking, some of them are a bit odd, you know?You know, I'm part of it, but...I'd people would make the world go round though.[1:58:07] Oh yeah, I mean for sure, I'm not criticizing, I'm fucking weird, look at what I'm doing.You're weird, yeah.Definitely weird.But some people, I find it easy to talk to, I know, it's just for me as a guy who likes both of you guys.I don't like that you don't talk anymore.I don't like that you have this beef.I've asked Gordon to define it.He doesn't define it.It's very difficult.He doesn't say anything bad about you, but he doesn't define it.I mean, I just love fucking around.Like, Australia, we love attacking each other.Like, I say worse things to my friends than I say to Gordon.You're not a comedian.Listen, I'm a comedian.I know about that.So it's like, I to each other too.Some guys are so good to provoke you.Get a good fucking reaction out of them, you know?Well, with comedians, you know who you can hang out with by who can take shit.You know, because if someone makes fun of me, if it's funny, I laugh.But if you make fun of some people and they're like, hey, they're like, oh, you get you, softy.You just lost.Oh, you fucked up.You take yourself seriously.You gotta roll the punches.You just take what you do seriously, but you never take yourself seriously.[1:59:05] That's so silly.There's no benefit to that.Because then you don't get to enjoy the laughs when someone makes fun of you.Someone makes fun of you and it's rude.If you're watch Kill Tony.Yeah, yeah.When David Lucas and Tony Hinchkov go out each other, it is one of my favorite things in life.They're both so fucking ruthless and hilarious, but if David gets Tony, Tony laughs hard and if Tony gets David, David laughs hard.They laugh.They love each other.They're really good friends, but they're fucking ruthless when it comes to that shit, when they're roasting each other.But they're having a good time.Like if you roast someone and they get like actually upset as a comedian, all the other comedians will be like, oh look at you.You're upset at a joke.You fucking hypocrite.Like what's wrong with you?Well that's what I mean.Gordon says bro, you suck, you never want anything.I'm like, bro, I could just argue that.You know that?It's like, relax.Is that, like, what is the the beef though like it doesn't make sense?[2:00:05] I mean for me I'm just having a good time like it's like I'm in a sport of people that take themselves very seriously Right and it's this he takes himself very seriously.So it's just like I like so you like picking on him I like yeah, you know, I mean like I mean like what you say like a mediums, you know if someone's To get a tear of it sometimes, you know?Yeah.And it's good material.He's like, he's just walking good material, you know?It's like he's provoking me.How's that?Well, he was just post something that I'm like, I swear, I'm like, this guy's playing a fucking character.He's a genius, but it's real.And I'm like, he's baiting me.I gotta say something.Well, you something.Well you are probably the funniest guy in Jiu-Jitsu other than Eddie.Eddie's hilarious.Eddie loves the jugs too.He gets a sometimes I pass on him some deeper levels of the jugs and he gets the full story.Love that we go deep conspiracy on the Jiu-Jitsu jugs.Oh no Eddie's Eddie is fucking hilarious.He's one of the funniest people I've ever met.I'm so glad he's doing stand-up again too because I tried to talk to him and he'd do standup a long time ago, like back in 2001, [2:01:07] like dude, I'm telling you, just try, it'll suck it first, but just like, it sucked when I learned you did do.You suck it first, but you have the ability to do it.I've become, yeah.He took a long time off it, but when he was teaching, he would teach classes and especially seminars, he would have like material.Oh yeah.During seminars, it was hilarious.And then he's like, I think I'm gonna do comedy again.So teaching seminars.That's what I do instead.I'll say the same joke.And then I'll look over and I'll be like, fuck that guy, I was at another seminar.I said the same thing.I'm like, he knows.He knows my tricks.Yeah.Yeah, if they already know the jokes, it's like a little bit of an issue.And I'm like, fuck if I said this a few too many times now.Yeah.Switch topics.Yeah, you gotta make new stuff up.You gotta make up new stuff for seminars.When you go and do seminars, you find it, it's a lot of MMA fighters that are wanting to learn Jiu Jitsu, is it just Jiu Jitsu guys?Is it a mixture?I mean nowadays, man, it's such a variety of people.Sometimes even beginners, like white belts will show up [2:02:06] and they're just coming to hang out.I love doing seminars all around the world and just meeting the people that are doing the sport.And I keep met a really affordable price because I always remember when people would come to my city, sometimes the seminars were so expensive, I couldn't afford it.So I just insist we book a big venue, we keep the prices were so expensive I couldn't afford it.So I just insist we book a big venue we keep the prices low.And I just get to see who from that country is participating in the sport, you know?I just love it.Is that you enjoy that more than competing now?Just going around and doing seminars?I enjoy like all aspects of it.You know like obviously too many seminars exhausting.I've done like back to back to back to back.I like to see when I be 30 hours and then out of there, otherwise it's too much social interaction, you know?We probably also don't absorb anything after three hours.It's like, and I have to roll.Like I still run the gauntlet, I try to roll as many people as possible.That's a good hair raise.You fucking try to kill me.Yeah, I'm sure.Bro, you paid to come to you like me, what are you doing to me?Yeah, I like, so I'll be hung over, jet lags, and it'll be like, I'll be do, [2:03:06] I'll do like, sometimes one hour, one and a half hours straight, and you go every three minutes.Oh God.And I'm like, what are you doing to me, but it's fucking one hour in and you're trying to kill me.Yeah, after a while.Test your patience, that's like and stories so that Hickson would do a seminar and then take all the black belts there and just tap them one after another.I try to do fucked up shit to people though, you know, like just crazy stupid submissions, you know that keeps it entertaining for me.Crab walks, like the Boston crab?Yeah, the Boston crab.I love hitting a Boston crab, I'm like you will remember that forever.You see that one guy who did it never made?Yeah, he is.Yeah.One guy who did it in MMA?Yeah, he is.So crazy.Man, that would hurt.I've never been put in it.But yeah, what is it, is it a flexibility thing?Is it a spine thing?I think it'll break your spine.Yeah.I do it to people from Mount, I give them Mount and then I put my toes in the armpits, take them over the top, bust them, crabber.Yeah.that's the most enjoyable thing.The, yeah, here's the dude who did it in MMA.[2:04:08] How did he set it up?Jesus.He just climbed over the top.He got his legs.The other guy looks like he's fighting for his life and nothing's happening.Well, the other guy looks a little out of shape too.He's just a little nookies to the face.It's like he's already ready for it.It almost looks fake.I don't think it's fake.I think it's just a low level MMA show.Wow.That's crazy.Fuck that guy would never hear the end of that.I remember a guy used to train with, uh, he actually sponsors me and he had MMA fight and he tapped E1 for three rounds.And a minute to go.I think 30 seconds to go.He crossed his leg from back.Oh, no.And I fucking remind him of it to this day.It's been years.That is a crazy submission.That hurts, you know?Oh, it hurts like hell, but you got to imagine like if you're winning the fight, I've, I don't think I've ever seen an MMA fight where someone tapped [2:05:00] to that.I'll send it to you.But guys do it.Guys do it even Hicks and did it when Hicks and submitted Funakis crossed his legs.He guess he just rather have the squeeze and if the guy threatens it he'll let it go.Yeah.Sometimes I think it's about being relaxed.It's like if you're doing this they can catch it really tough and she angles her relax.Sometimes they slip off the top.Right.I think relaxing in those positions sometimes helps.We're also being hyper aware of when the guy lifts his leg up to try to lock it.But yeah, I've had it done to me before.It's fucking horrible.People try to do that to me at seminars like that.I try and play around and then catch me with some shit.I'm just like fucking relax guy.Fuckin'.You have to always be aware, right?Because you're dealing with people trying to get a reputation.You try to break my legs, everything.Have you ever tapped at seminars?Yeah, I tapped, but I'll give them a couple more so they don't believe it, you know?Their friends will believe they get me once, but not three times, you know?What do you mean?Like if a blue belt taps me to seminar, one time maybe people believe.So you love to tap your couple times?I'm gonna to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.[2:06:05] I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked to story farm.I'm fucked like, guys, I'm gonna give you positions, but like, if you get it, I'll tap, like, relax.I don't try to do it.Yeah, I got shit to do, like, don't roll my neck.Yeah, they try, yeah, some of guys try to kill you.Necks are a bad one too, man, when you get a hurt neck was like, oh, and your neck is gone.Like, that's a fucking creepy one.That's crazy, yeah.I think I just retire at that point, you know?Chris, why haven't got his dick replaced?Whoops, sorry Chris.I think he got his disc replaced as well.I think he got the same thing.And there's a few guys who've had disc replaced [2:07:00] in their back and in their neck.You know, they can do that titanium articulating disc now, like where it allows your neck to move pretty normally, but you know, like how long has that last?I just tap to everything and not putting much effort and I feel like he's my body safe.You know what I mean?Like if I'm training and the guys go and hide them, like, all right, he got it, right?Yeah, I'm like, let's just, that's smart.But that's an ego thing.You have a healthy ego.I'm just like, who cares?Like it's like, yeah, that's the point, you know?Well, it's definitely better than going out like, you know, Vinnie, Vinnie Magalais, letting your fucking leg get destroyed like that.If you can just relax like that and allow yourself to get tapped, you will save so many injuries.I control the security footage in the cameraman though so you know like I make the footage disappear if you get something.Oh in your gym?Yeah that's really a shame.Get delayed that.That's the problem right guys want to release footage.I want to sell it.Hey like if people come to the gym I'm like well let you tap me.Give me some money.Yeah you can take it home.Well, listen Craig, good luck on this.[2:08:06] I really hope it works out.I hope ADCC isn't too pissed at you.And I hope you've started a trend.And I hope this isn't gonna look at that.The bowl.It's 18 bowls.I hope it, 80 days, 20 hours, 58 minutes, and 47 seconds until it starts from right now.That's not reassuring, that's close.Yeah, it is.80 days is not a long amount of time.But I hope it works out and I really hope that it elevates the sport.And at the very least it's getting some eyeballs on the sport.Get some new eyeballs for sure.Yeah, thanks for letting me talk about it.My pleasure.So tell everybody how to find you on Instagram and how to find the website for the event.Craig Jones, BGJ.com.We sell tickets to this, sorry, Craig Jones, BGJ for Instagram, UNLV.com is where tickets will be up on the 31st.So at the Thomas Mac website.Thomas Mac website and then Fairfive Foundation is the website with all the information that's [2:09:02] what we saw there.And CJA official is the Instagram page where it's meant to be professional, but it's gonna be mostly memes.Mostly memes?Mostly memes and jokes.Okay.We had a spelling around the poster we left it.I was like, fight, we fucked up, we'll commit to it.All right, beautiful.All right, man, well good luck and make sure you count all that before you leave.Yeah, so I'm just going to cut it out.Thank you, bye everybody.\",\n",
       " \"What's happening?Oh you know not too much.Just another typical week in AI.Just the beginning of the end of time.That's all happening right now.Just for the sake of the listeners, please just give us your names and tell us what you do.So I'm Jeremy Harris.I'm the CEO and co-founder of this company Gladstone AI that we co-founded.So we're essentially a national security and AI company we can get into the backstory a little bit later, but that's the high level.Yeah, and I'm Ed Harris.I'm actually I'm his co-founder and brother and the CTO of the company.Keep this like pull this up like a fist from your face.There you go perfect.So how long have you guys been involved in the whole AI space?For a while in different ways.So we actually, we started off as physicists.Like that was our background.And in like around 2017, we started to go into AI startups.So we found it a startup took you through Y Combinator, this like Silicon Valley accelerator program.At the time, actually Sam Altman, who's now the CEO of OpenAI, was the president of Y Combinator.So he opened up our batch at YC with this big speech and we got some conversations in with him over the course of the batch then in 2020 so this this thing happened that we could talk about essentially this was like the moment that There's like a before and after in the world of AI before and after 2020 and It launched this Revolution that brought us to chat GPT Essentially, there was an insight that open AI had and doubled down on that you can draw straight us to chat GPT.Essentially, there was an insight that OpenAI had and doubled down on that you can draw a straight line to chat GPT, GPT-4, Google Gemini, everything that makes AI everything it is today started then.And when it happened, we kind of went, well, it had gave me a call, this like panic phone call, he's like, dude, [2:01] I don't think we can keep working like businesses usual in a regular company anymore.Yeah.So there was this AI model called GPT3.So like everyone has maybe played with GPT4.It's like ChatGPT.GPT3 was the generation before that.And it was the first time that you had an AI model that could actually, let's say, do stuff like write news articles that the average person, like in a paragraph of a news article, could not tell the difference between it wrote this news article in a real person wrote this news article.So that was an inflection.That was, you know, significant in itself.But what was most significant was that it represented a point along this line, this scaling trend for AI, where the signs were that you didn't have to be clever, you didn't have to come up with necessarily a revolutionary new algorithm or be smart about [3:01] it.You just had to take what works and make it way, way, bigger.And the significance of that is you increase the amount of computing cycles you put against something, you increase the amount of data.All of that is an engineering problem and you can solve it with money.So you've got, you can scale up the system, use it to make money and put that money right back into scaling up the system some more money in IQ points come out.Cheers.That was kind of the 2020 moment.And that's what we said in 2020, exactly.I spent about two hours trying to argue out of it.I was like, no, no, no, no, like we can keep working at our company because we're having fun.Like we like founding companies.And yeah, he just like wrestling me to the ground and we're like, shit, we gotta do something about this.We reached out to like a family friend who, you know, he was non-technical but he had some connections in government in DOD and we're like, dude, the way this is set up right now, you can really start drawing straight lines and extrapolating and saying, you know what, [4:02] the government is going to give a shit about this in not very long, two years, four years, we're not sure, but the knowledge about what's going on here is so siloed in the frontier labs.Like, our friends, all over the frontier labs, the OpenAI, the Google Debt Minds, all that stuff, the shit they were saying to us that was like mundane reality, like water cooler conversation, when you then went to talk to people in policy and even like pretty senior people in government, not tracking the story remotely.In fact, you're hearing almost a diametric opposite.This is like over learning the lessons of the AI winters that came before when it's pretty clear like we're on a very at least interesting trajectory, let's say, that should change the way we're thinking about the technology.What was your fear?Like, what was it that hit you that made you go, we have to stop doing this?So it's basically, anyone can draw a straight line on a graph.The key is looking ahead and actually at that point, [5:02] three years out, four years out and asking, like you're asking, what does this mean for the world?What does it mean?What does the world have to look like if we're at this point?And we're already seeing the first wave of risk sets just begin to materialize.And that's kind of the weaponization risk sets.So you think about stuff like large scale psychological manipulation of social media.Actually really easy to do now.You train a model on just a whole bunch of tweets.You can actually direct it to push a narrative like maybe China should own Taiwan or whatever, something like that.And you actually, you can train it to adjust the discourse and have increasing levels of effectiveness to that.And you actually, you can train it to adjust the discourse and have increasing levels of effectiveness to that, just as you increase the general capability surface of these systems, we don't know how to predict what exactly comes out of them at each level of scale, but it's just general increasing power.And then the kind of next beat of risk after that.[6:08] So we're scaling these systems, we're on track to scale systems that are at human level, like generally as smart, however you define that as a person or a greater and open AI and the other labs are saying, yeah, it might be two years away, three years away, four years away, like insanely close.At the same time, and we can go into the details of this, but we actually don't understand how to reliably control these systems.We don't understand how to get these systems to do what it is we want.We can kind of like poke them and prod them and get them to kind of adjust, but you've seen, and we can go over these examples.We've seen example after example of, you know, Bing Sidney, yelling at users, Google, showing 17th century British scientists that are racially diverse, all that kind of stuff.We don't really understand how to like aim it [7:02] or align it or steer it.And so then you can ask yourself, well, we're on track to get here.We are not on track to control these systems effectively.How bad is that?And the risk is if you have a system that is significantly smarter than humans or human organization, that we basically get disempowered in various ways relative to that system.And we can go into some details on that too.Now, when a system does something like what Gemini did, like what says show us Nazi soldiers that it shows you Asian women, and like what is, what's the mechanism?Like how does that happen?So it's maybe worth, yeah, taking a step back and looking at how these systems actually work.Because that's gonna give us a bit of a frame too for figuring out when we see weird shit happen.How weird is that shit?Is that shit just explainable by just the basic mechanics of what you would expect to happen [8:00] based on the way we were training these things?Or is something new and fundamentally different happening.So talking about this idea of scaling these AI systems, right?What does that actually mean?Well, you imagine the AI model, which is kind of like you think of it as like the artificial brain here that actually does the thinking.That model contains, it's kind of like a human brain, it's got these things called neurons, we and the human brain called them biological neurons in the context of AI's artificial neurons, but it doesn't really matter, that the cells that do the thinking for the machine.And the realization of AI scaling is that you can basically take this model, increase the number of artificial neurons it contains.And at the same time, increase the amount of computing power that you're putting into kind of like wiring the connections between those neurons.That's the training process.Can I pause you right there?Yeah.How does the neuron think?Yeah, so okay, so let's get a little bit more concrete then.So in your brain, right, we have these neurons, they're all connected to each other with different connections.And when you go out into the world and you learn new skill, what really happens is you try out that skill, you succeed or fail, and based on your succeeding or failing, the connections between [9:05] neurons that are associated with doing that task well gets stronger, the connections that are associated with doing it badly get weaker.And over time, through this glorified process of trial and error, eventually you're going to hone in and really, in a very real sense, everything you know about the world gets implicitly encoded in the strengths of the connections between all those neurons.If I can x-ray your brain and get all the connection strengths of all the neurons, I have everything Joe Rogan has learned about the world.That's basically the good sketch, let's say, of what's going on here.So now we apply that to AI, right?That's the next step.And here, really, That's the next step.And here really it's the same story.We have these massive systems, artificial neurons connected to each other.The strength of those connections is secretly what encodes all the knowledge.So if I can steal all of those connections, those weights as they're sometimes called, I've stolen the model.I've stolen the artificial brain.[10:01] I can use it to do whatever the model could do initially.That is kind of the artifact of central interest here.And so if you can build the system, right?Now you've got so many moving parts.Like if you look at GPT-4, it has people think around a trillion of these connections.And that's a trillion little pieces that all have to be jiggered together to work together coherently.And you need computers to go through and tweak those numbers.So massive amounts of computing power.The bigger you make that model, the more computing power you're going to need to tune it in.And now you have this relationship between the size of your model, the amount of computing power you're going to use to train it.And if you can increase those things at the same time, what Ed was saying is your IQ points basically drop out.Very roughly speaking, that was what people realized in 2020 and the effect that had was now all of a sudden the entire AI industry is looking at this equation.Everybody knows the secret sauce.I make it bigger, I make more IQ points, I can get more money.So Google's looking at this, Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, everybody's looking at the same equation.[11:02] You have the makings for a crazy race.Like right now today, sorry, Microsoft, is engaged in the single biggest infrastructure in human history.Build out the biggest infrastructure.Build out.$50 billion a year, right?So on the scale of the Apollo moon landings, just in building out data centers to house the compute infrastructure because they are betting that these systems are going to get them to something like human-level AI pretty damn soon.So I was reading some story about I think it was Google that saying that they're going to have multiple nuclear reactors to power their database.That's what you got to do now because what's going on is North America is kind of running out of on grid base load power to actually supply these data centers.You're getting data center building moratoriums in areas like Virginia, which has traditionally been like the data center cluster for Amazon, for example, and for a lot of these other [12:04] companies.And so when you build a data center, you need a bunch of resources sighted close to that data center.You need water for cooling and a source of electricity.And it turns out that wind and solar don't really quite cut it for these big data centers that train big models.Because the data center, the training consumes power like this all the time, but the sun isn't always shining, the wind isn't always blowing.And so you got to build nuclear reactors, which give you high capacity factor base load.And Amazon literally bought, yeah, a data center with a nuclear plant right next to it, because like, that's what you got to do.Jesus.How long does it take to build a nuclear reactor?Because it's so like this is the race, right?The race is, you're talking about 2020, people realizing this, then you have to have the power to supply it.But how long, how many years does it take to get an active nuclear reactor up and running?[13:02] It's an answer that depends.The Chinese are faster than us at building nuclear reactors, for example.And that's part of the geopolitics of this too, right?Like when you look at US versus China, what is bottlenecking each country, right?So the US is bottlenecked increasingly by power, based load power, China, because we've got export control measures in place, in part as a response to the scaling phenomenon.As a result of the investigation we did.That's right, yeah.In part, in part.Yeah.But China is bottlenecked by their access to the actual processors.They've got all the power they can eat, because they've got much more infrastructure investment, but the chip side is weaker.So, there's sort of like balancing act between the two sides, and it's not clear yet like which one positions you strategically for dominance in long-term.But we are also building better, more like so small modular reactors.Essentially small nuclear power plants that can be mass-produced.Those are starting to come online relatively early, [14:01] but the technology and designs are pretty mature.So that's probably the next beat for our power grid for data centers, I would imagine.Microsoft is doing this.So in 2020, you have this revelation you recognize where this is going.You see how it charts and you say, this is going to be a real problem.Does anybody listen to you?This is where the problem comes, right?Yeah, like we said, right?You can draw a straight line.You can have people nodding along, but there's a couple of like hiccups along the way.One, is that straight line really gonna happen?All you're doing is like drawing lines on charts, right?I don't really believe that that's gonna happen, and that's one thing.The next thing is just just imagining is this, is this what's gonna come to pass as a result of that?And then the third thing is, well, yeah, that sounds important, but like not my problem.That sounds like an important problem for somebody else.And so we did do a bit of a traveling.Yeah, it was like the world's saddest traveling roadshow.[15:02] It was literally as dumb as this sound.So we go and, oh my God, I mean, it's almost embarrassing to think back on, but so 2020 happens, yes, within months, first of all, we're like, we gotta figure out how to hand off our company.So we handed off to two of our earliest employees, they did an amazing job, company exited, that's great.But that was only because they're so good at what they do.We then went, what the hell, like how can you steer this situation?How do you, we just thought we got to wake up the US government as stupid and naive as that sounds, like that was the big picture goal.So we start to line up as many briefings as we possibly can across the US interagency, all the departments, all the agencies that we can find, climbing our way up.We got an awful lot like Ed said of like that sounds like a wicked important problem for somebody else to solve yeah defense home lines of security and then the state department yeah so we end up exactly this this meeting with like there's about a dozen folks from the state department and one of them and i i hope at some point uh...you know history recognizes what what she did her team did because it was the first time that somebody actually [16:03] stood up and said first of all, sounds like a serious issue.I see the argument makes sense to I own this.And three, I'm going to put my own career capital behind this.That's the.And that was at the end of 2021.So imagine that.That's a year before chat GPT, nobody was tracking this issue.You had to have the imagination to draw like through that line, understand what it meant, and then believe, yeah, I'm going to risk some career capital on this in a risk of Earth's government.This is the only reason that we even were able to publicly talk about the investigation in the first place because by the time this whole assessment was commissioned, it was just before chat GPT came out, the IFSauron was not yet on this.And so there was a view that like, yeah, sure, you can publish the results of this kind of, not nothing burger investigation, but you can sure go ahead.And it just became this insane story.We had like the UKI Safety Summit, we had the White House Executive Order, [17:01] all this stuff which became entangled with the work we were doing.Which we simply could not have, especially some of the reports we were collecting from the labs, the whistleblower reports, that could not have been made public if there, if it wasn't for the foresight of this team, really pushing for as well the American population to hear about it.Now, I could see how if you were one of the people that saw on this expansion man-minded.All you're thinking about is getting this up and running.You guys are paying the ass, right?So you're obviously doing something really ridiculous.You're stopping your company.You can make more money staying there and continuing the process.But you recognize that there's like an existential threat involved in making this stuff go online.When this stuff is live, you can't undo it.Oh yeah, no matter how much money you're making, the dumbest thing to do is to stand by as something that completely transcends money is being developed and it's just going to screw you over if things go badly.[18:01] But what is there people that push back against this and what is their argument.Yeah so actually for and I'll I'll let you follow up on the but there the first story of the push back I think it's kind of a it's been in the news a little bit lately now getting more and more public but the when we started this and like no one was talking about it The one group that was actually pushing sort of stuff in this space was a big funder in the area of like effective altruism.I think you know, may have heard of them.This is kind of a Silicon Valley group of people who have a certain mindset about how you pick tough problems to work on, valuable problems to work on.They've had all kinds of issues.Sam Bankman freed was one of them and all that quite famously.So we're not effective ultra-us, but because these are the folks who are working in the space, we decided, well, we'll talk to them.And the first thing they told us was, don't talk to the government about this.Their position was, if you bring this to the attention of the government, they will go, oh shit, powerful AI systems, and they're not going to hear about the dangers, so they're going to somehow go out and build the powerful systems without caring about the rest side.[19:10] Which, when you're in that startup mindset, you want to fail cheap.You don't want to just make assumptions about the world and be like, okay, let's not touch it.Our instinct was, okay, let's just test this a little bit and talk to a couple people, see how they respond, tweak the like kind of keep keep climbing that that ladder that's the kind of you know build their mindset that we came from Silicon Valley and and we found that people are way more thoughtful about this than you would imagine and in DOD especially DOD is actually has a very safety-oriented culture with their tech like the thing is because like they're there's stuff like kills people right and they know their stuff kills people, right?And they know there's stuff kills people.And so they have an entire safety-oriented development practice to make sure that their stuff doesn't go off the rails.And so you can actually bring up these concerns with them, and it lands in kind of a ready culture.[20:00] But one of the issues with the individuals we spoke to who were saying don't talk to government is that they had just not actually interacted with any of the folks that they were kind of talking about and imagining that they knew what was in their heads.And so they were just giving incorrect advice.And frankly, like, so we work with DOD now on actually deploying AI systems in a way that's safe and secure.And the truth is, at the time when we got that advice, which was like late 2020, reality is, you could have made it your life's mission to try to get the Department of Defense to build an AGI and like you would not have succeeded because nobody was paying attention.Wow.Because they just didn't know.Yeah, there's a chasm, right?There's a gap to cross.Like there's information.Yeah, there's information spaces that DOD folks like operate in and work in.There's information spaces that Silicon Valley and tech operated in.They're a little more [21:03] convergent today, but especially at the time, they were very separate.And so the briefings we did, we had to constantly iterate on like clarity, making it very kind of clear and explaining it and all that stuff, years it.And that was the piece to your question about like the pushback in a way from inside the house.I mean, that was the people who cared about the risk.Yeah.The man.When we actually went into the labs, so some labs, not all labs are created equal.It should make that point.When you talk to whistleblowers, what we found was, so there's one lab that's really great.So anthropic, when you talk to people there, you don't have the sense that you're talking to a whistleblower who's nervous about telling you whatever roughly speaking what you know the executive say to the public is aligned with what they're their researchers say it's all very very open more more closely i think than any of the other story i'm more more closely than any of the others always you know there are always variations here and there but [22:00] uh...some of the other labs like very different.And you had the sense like we were in a room with one of the frontier labs.We're talking to their leadership, this part of the investigation.And there was somebody from, anyway, it won't be too specific, but there was somebody in the room who then took us to the side after.And he hands me his phone.He's like, hey, can you please, like put your phone number.Or no, yeah, he put his number in my phone.And then he kind of like whispered to me, he's like, hey, so whatever recommendations you guys are going to make, I would urge you to be more ambitious.And I was like, what does that mean?He's like, can we just talk later?So as happened in many, many cases, we had a lot of cases where we set up bar meetups after the fact where we would talk to these folks and get them in an informal setting.He shared some pretty sobering stuff and in particular the fact that he did not have confidence in his lab's leadership to live up to their publicly stated word on what they [23:00] would do when they were approaching AGI and even now to secure and make these systems safe.So many such cases, this is like kind of one specific example, but it's not that you ever had lab leadership come in or doors getting kicked down and people are waking us up in the middle of the night.It was that you had this looming cloud over everybody that you really felt some of the people with the most access and information who understood the problem the most deeply were the most hesitant to bring things forward because they sort of understood that their lab's not going to be happy with this.And so it's very hard to also get an extremely broad view of this from inside the labs because you know you open it up, you start to talk to, we spoke to a couple of dozen people about various issues in total.You go much further than that and where it starts to get around.And so we had to kind of strike that balance as we spoke to folks from you share these labs.Now, when you say approaching AGI, [24:01] how does one know when a system has achieved AGI, and does the system have an obligation to alert you?Well, by, you know, the Turing test, right?Yes.So you have a conversation with a machine and it can fool you into thinking that it's a human.That was the bar for AGI for, you know, a few decades.That's kind of already happened.Yeah.Like close to it.Yeah.Yeah.Like close to it.Yeah.For zero is close to it, for four.Different forms of the Turing test have been passed, different forms have been proposed, and there is a feeling among a lot of people that goal posts are being shifted.Now, the definition of AGI itself is kind of interesting, right, because we're not necessarily fans of the term, because usually when people talk about AGI, they're talking about a specific circumstance in which there are capabilities they care about.So some people use AGI to refer to the wholesale automation of all labor, right?That's one.Some people say, well, when you build AGI, it's like it's automatically going [25:02] to be hard to control and there's a risk to civilization, so that's a different threshold.All these different ways of defining it, ultimately, it can be more useful to think sometimes about advanced AI and the different thresholds of capability you cross and the implications of those capabilities, but it is probably going to be more like a fuzzy spectrum, which, in a way, it makes it harder, right?It would be great to have a...Like a trip wire where you're like, oh, like this is bad, okay.Like we, you know, we gotta do something.But because there's no threshold that we can like really put our fingers on, we're like a frog and boiling water in some sense where it's like, oh, like just gets a little better, a little better, oh, like we're still fine.And not just we're still fine, but as the system improves below that threshold, life gets better and better.These are incredibly valuable beneficial systems.We do roll stuff out like this again at DoD and various customers.And it's massively valuable.[26:02] It allows you to accelerate all kinds of back office, like paperwork, BS.It allows you to do all sorts of wonderful things.And our expectation is that's going to keep happening until it suddenly doesn't.Yeah, one of the things that there was a guy we were talking to from one of the labs and he was saying, look, the temptation to put a heavier foot on the pedal is going to be greatest, just as the risk is greatest, because that's, you know, it's dual use technology, right?Every positive capability increasingly starts to introduce, basically a situation where the destructive footprint of malicious actors who weaponize the system, or just of the system itself, just grows and grows and grows.So you can't really have one without the other.The question is always how do you balance those things, But in terms of defining AI, it's a challenging thing.Yeah, that's something that one of our friends at the lab pointed out.The closer we get to that point, the more the temptation will be to hand these systems the keys to our data center because [27:01] they can do such a better job of managing those resources and assets.And if we don't do it, Google will.And if they don't do it, Microsoft will.Like the competition, the competitive dynamics are a really big part of this issue.Yes.So there's just a mad race to who knows what?Exactly.Yeah.That's actually the best summary I've heard.I mean, like no one knows what the magic threshold is.It's just these things keep getting smarter.So we might as well keep turning that crank.And as long as scaling works, right, we have a knob, a dial, we can just tune.And we have more IQ points out.Well, from your understanding of the current landscape, how far away are we looking at something being implemented with the whole world changes?Arguably, the whole world is already changing as a result of this technology.The US government is in the process of task organizing around various risk sets for this.That takes time.[28:01] The private sector is reorganizing.Open AI will roll out an update that obliterates the jobs of illustrators from one day to the next, obliterates the jobs of translators from one day to the next.This is probably net beneficial for society because we can get so much more art and so much more translation done.But is the world already being changed as a result of this?Yeah, absolutely.Geopolitically, economically, industrially.Yeah.Of course, it's like not to say anything about the value, the purpose that people lose from that, right?So there's the economic benefit, but there's the social, cultural hit that we take too.Right, and then there's the implementation of universal basic income, which keeps getting discussed in regards to this.We ask chat GPT-40 the other day in the green room where we're like, you know, are you going to replace people?Like, well, what will people do for money?And then, well, universal basic income will have to be considered.You don't want a bunch of people just on the dole working for the fucking sky net.[29:00] Yeah.You know, because that's kind of what it is.I mean, one of the challenges is like the, so much of this is untested and we don't know how to, how to even roll that out.Like we can't predict what the capabilities of the next level of scale will be, right?So open AI literally, and this is what's happened every, with every beat, right?They build the next level of scale and they get to sit back along with the rest of us and be surprised at the gifts that fall out of the scaling pinata as they keep whacking it.And because we don't know what capabilities are going to come with that level of scale, we can't predict what jobs are going to be on the line next.We can't predict how people are going to use these systems, how they'll be augmented.So there's no real way to kind of task organize around like who gets what in the redistribution, redistribution game?And some of the thresholds that we've already passed are like a little bit freaky.So even as of 2023, GPT-4, Microsoft and OpenAI and some other organizations did various assessments of it before rolling it out.And it's absolutely capable of deceiving a human and has done that successfully.So one of the tests that they did, kind of famously, [30:07] is they had a, it was given a job to solve a capture.And at the time, it didn't have...Just playing capture, what people would say.Yeah, yeah, yeah.So it's this, now it's like kind of hilarious and quaint, but it's this, you know...Are you a robot test?Are you a robot test with like writing them online?Yeah, online, exactly.That's it.So if you want to create an account, they don't want robots creating a billion accounts.So they give you this test to prove you're a human.And at the time, GPD for like now, it can just solve captures.But at the time, it couldn't look at images.It was just a text, right?It was a text engine.And so what it did is it connected to a task rabbit worker and was like, hey, can you help me solve this capture?The task rabbit worker comes back to it and says, you're not a bot are you?Ha ha ha.Like, call in it out.And you can actually see so the way they built it is so they could see a read out of what it was thinking [31:01] to its stuff.Scratch pad.Yeah, Crashpad.It's called, but you can see basically as it's writing, it's thinking to itself.It's like, I can't tell this worker that I'm a bot because then it won't help me solve the cap shot, so I have to lie.And it was like, no, I'm not a bot.I'm a visually impaired person.And the task rabbit worker was is, so right now, if you look at the government response to this, what are the tools that we have to oversee this?And when we did our investigation, we came out with some recommendations too.It was stuff like, yeah, you got to license these things.You get to a point where these systems are so capable that, yeah, if you're talking about a system that can literally execute cyber attacks at scale or literally help you design bio weapons and we're getting early indications that that is absolutely the course that we're on.Maybe literally everybody should not be able to completely freely download, modify, use in various ways these systems.It's very thorny obviously.[32:00] But if you want to have a stable society that seems like it's starting to be a prerequisite.So the idea of licensing, as part of that, you need a way to evaluate systems.You need a way to say which systems are safe and which aren't.And this idea of AI evaluations has kind of become this touchstone for a lot of people's solutions.And the problem is that we're already getting to the point where AI systems in many cases can tell when they're being evaluated and modify their behavior accordingly.So there's like this one example that came out recently, Anthropic, they're called two chatbot.So they basically ran this test called a needle in a haystack test.So what's that?Well, you feed the model, like imagine a giant chunk of text all of Shakespeare and then somewhere in the middle that giant chunk of text you put a sentence like Burger King makes the best wapper.Sorry the wapper is the best burger or something like that right?Then you turn to the model after you fed it this giant pile of text with a little fact hidden somewhere inside you ask it What's the best burger?Right, you're gonna test basically to see how well can it recall that stray fact that was buried somewhere in that giant pile of text.So the system responds, [33:08] yeah, well, I can tell you want me to say the whopper is the best burger.But it's oddly out of place, this fact in this whole body of text.So I'm assuming that you're either playing around with me or that you're testing my capabilities.And so this is just a kind of context awareness, right?And the challenges when we talk to people at like meter and other sort of AI evaluations labs, this is a trend like not the exception.This is possibly possibly going to be the rule.As these systems get more scaled and sophisticated, they can pick up on more and more subtle statistical indicators that they're being tested.We've already seen them adapt their behavior on the basis of their understanding that they're being tested.You run into this problem where the only tool that we really have at the moment, which is just throwing a bunch of questions at this thing and seeing how it responds, like, hey, make a bio weapon, hey, like, do this DDoS attack, whatever.[34:07] We can't really assess, because there's a difference between what the model puts out and what it potentially could put out if it assesses that it's being tested and there are consequences for that.One of my fears is that AGI is gonna recognize how shitty people are, because we like to bullshit ourselves.We like to kind of pretend and justify and rationalize a lot of human behavior from everything to taking all the fish out of the ocean to dumping off toxic waste in third world countries, sourcing of minerals that are used in everyone's cell phones in the most horrific way.All these things, like my real fear is that AGI is not gonna have a lot of sympathy for a creature that's that flawed and lies to itself.AGI is absolutely going to recognize how shitty people are.[35:00] Not, it's hard to answer the question from a moral standpoint, but from the standpoint of our own intelligence and capabilities.So you think about it like this.The kinds of mistakes that these AI systems make.So you look at, for example, GPT-40 has one mistake that it used to make quite recently, where if you ask it, just repeat the word company over and over and over again.It will repeat the word company, and then somewhere in the middle of that, it'll just snap.It'll just snap and just start saying, like, weird, I forget, like, what the...Oh, it's like...It's talking about itself, how it's suffering.Like, it depends on, it varies from case to case.It's suffering by having to repeat the word company over again.So this is called, it's called rant mode internally, or at least this is the name that they use.Yeah, we're friends mentioned.There is an engineering line item in at least one of the top labs to beat out of the system, [36:00] this behavior known as rant mode.Now rant mode is interesting because.Existentialism.Sorry, existentialism.This is one kind of rent mode.Now rent mode is interesting because existentialism.Sorry, existentialism.This is one kind of rent mode.Yeah, sorry.So when we talk about existentialism, this is a kind of rent mode where the system will tend to talk about itself, refer to its place in the world, the fact that it doesn't want to get turned off sometimes, the fact that it's suffering, all that.That oddly is a behavior that emerged at, as far as we can tell, something around GPT-4 scale, and then has been persistent since then.And the labs have to spend a lot of time trying to beat this out of the system to ship it.It's literally like it's a KPI, like an engineering, a line item in the engineering, like task list.We're like, okay, we gotta, we gotta reduce existential outputs by like x percent this quarter.Like that is the goal.Because it's a convergent behavior, like at least it seems to be empirically with a lot of these models.Yeah, it's hard to say, but it seems to come up a lot.So that's weird in itself.[37:01] My, what I was trying to get at was actually just the fact that these systems make mistakes that are radically different from the kinds of mistakes humans make.And so we can look at those mistakes like, you know, GBD4 not being able to spell words correctly in an image or things like that and go, ah, haha, it's so stupid.Like I would never make that mistake, therefore this thing is so dumb.But what we have to recognize is we're building minds that are so alien to us that the set of mistakes that they make are just gonna be radically different from the set of mistakes that we make.Just like the set of mistakes that a baby makes is radically different from the set of mistakes that we make.Just like the set of mistakes that a baby makes is radically different from the set of mistakes that a cat makes.Like a baby is not as smart as an adult human.A cat is not as smart as an adult human, but they're, you know, they're unintelligent in, obviously, very different ways.A cat can get around the world.[38:02] A baby can't, but has other things that it can do that a cat can't.So now we have this third type of approach that we're taking to intelligence.There's a different set of errors that that thing will make.And so one of the risks taking it back to, like, will it be able to tell how shitty we are?Is right now we can see those mistakes really obviously because it thinks so differently from us.But as it approaches our capabilities, our mistakes are like all the like fucked up stuff that you have and I have in our brains is going to be really obvious to it because it thinks so differently from us.It's just going to be like, oh yeah, why are all these humans making these mistakes at the same time?So there is a risk that as you get to these capabilities, we really have no idea, but humans might be very hackable.We already know there's all kinds of social manipulation techniques that succeed against humans reliably.Con artists, oh yeah, persuasion is an art form [39:01] and a risk set and there are people who are world class at persuasion and are basically make bank from that.And those are just other humans with the same architecture that we have.They're also AI systems that are wicked good at persuasion today, like totally.Totally.I want to bring it back to suffering.What does it mean when it says it's suffering?So, okay, here, I'm just gonna draw a bit of a box around that, yeah, that aspect, right?So what we folk, we're very agnostic when it comes to suffering sentience.That's not part of, we're focused on that.Because nobody knows.Yeah, we literally, exactly.I can't prove the Joe Rogan's conscious, I can't prove that Ed Harris is conscious.So there's no way to really intelligently reason.There have been papers, by the way.One of the Godfather's of AI, Yachto Benjio put out a paper a couple months ago, looking at like, on all the different theories of consciousness, what are the requirements for consciousness and how many of those are satisfied by current AI systems, [40:03] and that itself was an interesting read, but ultimately, no one knows.There's no way around this problem.Our focus has been on the national security side.What are the concrete risks from weaponization, from loss of control that these systems introduce?That's not to say there hasn't been a lot of conversation internal to these labs about the issue you raised.It's an important issue right like it is a it's a freaking moral monstrosity humans have a very bad track record of thinking of others other stuff as other when it doesn't look exactly like us whether it's racially or even different species I mean it's not hard to imagine this being another category of that mistake it's just like one of the challenges is like, you can easily kind of get a get bog down in like consciousness versus loss of control.And those two things are actually separable or maybe.And anyways, so long way of saying, I think it's a great point.Yeah, so that question is important.[41:04] But it's also true that if we knew for an absolute certainty that there was no way these systems could ever become conscious, we would still have the national security risk set, and particularly the loss of control risk set.Because so again, like it comes back to this idea that we're scaling to systems that are potentially at or beyond human level.There's no reason to think it will stop at human level, that we are the pinnacle of what the universe can produce in intelligence.We're not on track, based on the conversations we've had with folks at the labs, to be able to control systems at that scale.And so one of the questions is, how bad is that?Is that bad?It sounds like it could be bad, right?Just intuitively, it's certainly it sounds like we're definitely entering, or potentially entering an area that is completely unprecedented in the history of the world.We have no precedent at all for human beings not being at the apex of intelligence in the globe.[42:06] We have examples of species that are intellectually dominant over other species, and it doesn't go that well for the other species, so we have some maybe negative examples there.But one of the key theoretical, and it has to be theoretical because until we actually build these systems, we won't know, One of the key theoretical lines of research in this area is something called power seeking and instrumental convergence.And what this is referring to is if you think of like yourself first off, whatever your goal might be, if your goal is, well, I'm'm gonna say if if me if my goal is to become you know a tiktok star or a janitor or the president of the United States whatever my goal is I'm less likely to accomplish that goal if I'm dead start from an obvious example and so therefore no matter what my goal is, I'm probably going to have an impulse [43:06] to want to stay alive.Similarly, I'm not going to be in a better position to accomplish my goal, regardless of what it is, if I have more money, right, if I make myself smarter.If I prevent you from getting into my head and changing my goal, that's another kind of subtle one, right?Like if my goal is, I want to become president.I don't want Joe messing with my head so that I change my goal because that would change the goal that I have.And so that, those types of things, like trying to stay alive, making sure that your goal doesn't get changed, accumulating power, trying to make yourself smarter.These are called convergent, essentially convergent goals because many different ultimate goals, regardless of what they are, go through those intermediate goals of want to make sure [44:02] I stay like they support no matter what goal you have, they will probably support that goal.Unless your goal is pathological, like I want to commit suicide, if that's your final goal, then you don't want to stay alive.But for most, the vast majority of possible goals that you could have, you will want to stay alive, you will want to not have your goal changed, you will want to basically accumulate power.And so one of the risks is if you dial that up to 11 and you have an AI system that is able to transcend our own attempt set containment, which is an actual thing that these labs are thinking about.Like how do we contain a system that's trying to specialize in testing?Do they have containment of it currently?Well right now the systems are probably too dumb to like, you know, want to be able to break out on the board.But then why are they suffering?This brings me back to my point.What it says it's suffering?Do you quiz it?It's, so that's the thing.It's writing that it's suffering, right?Yeah.It's...Is it just embodying life is suffering?Well, we can't actually, so these things are trained, actually this is maybe worth flagging.And by the way, just to kind of put a pin in what Ed was saying there, there's actually [45:09] a surprising amount of quantitative and empirical evidence for what he just laid out there.He's actually done this some of this research himself, but there are a lot of folks working on this.It's like, it sounds insane.It sounds speculative.It sounds wacky.But this is, is does appear to be kind of the default trajectory of the tech.So in terms of, yeah, these weird outputs, right?What does it actually mean?If the AI system tells you I'm suffering, right?Does that mean it is suffering?Is there actually a moral patient somewhere embedded in that system?The training process for these systems is actually worth considering here.So, you know, what is GPT-4?Really?What was it designed to be?How was it shaped?It's one of these artificial brains that we talked about, massive scale.And the task that it was trained to perform is a glorified version of text autocomplete.So you imagine taking every sentence on the internet roughly, feed it the first half of the sentence, [46:01] get it to predict the rest.The theory behind this is, you're gonna force the system to get really good at text auto complete.That means it must be good at doing things like completing sentences that sound like to counter-arising China, the United States should blank.Now, if you're gonna fill in that blank, you'll find yourself calling on massive reserves of knowledge that you have about what China is, what the US is, what it means for China to be ascendant, geopolitics, economic, all that shit.So, text auto-complete ends up being this interesting way of forcing an AI system to learn general facts about the world because if you can auto-complete, you must have some understanding of how the world works.So now you have this myopic psychotic optimization process where this thing is just obsessed with text auto-complete.Maybe, maybe, assuming that that's actually what it learned to want to pursue, we don't know whether that's the case.We can't verify that it wants that.Embedding a goal in a system is really hard.All we have is a process for training these systems, [47:01] and then we have the artifact that comes out the other end.We have no idea what goals actually get embedded in the system, what wants, what drives, actually get embedded in the system.But by default, it kind of seems like the things that we're training them to do end up misaligned with what we actually want from them.So the example of company company company company, right, and then you get all this like wacky text.Okay, clearly that's indicating that somehow the training process didn't lead to the kind of system that we necessarily want.Another example is take a text auto-complete system and ask it, I don't know, how should I bury a dead body?It will answer that question.It released if you frame it right, it will auto-complete and give you the answer.You don't necessarily want that if you're open AI, because you're gonna get sued for helping people bury dead bodies.And so we've got to get better goals basically to train these systems to pursue.We don't know what the effect is of training a system to be obsessed with text auto-complete.If in fact that is what it does have.It's also, yeah, it's important also to remember [48:01] that we don't know, nobody knows how to reliably get a goal into the system.So it's the difference between you understanding what I want you to do and you actually wanting to do it.So I can say, hey Joe, like get me a sandwich.You can understand that I want you to get me a sandwich, but you can be like, I don't feel like getting a sandwich.And so one of the issues is you can try to like train this stuff to basically, I don't feel like getting a sandwich.And so one of the issues is you can try to like train this stuff to basically, you don't want to anthropomorphize this too much, but you can kind of think of it as like, if you give the right answer, cool, you get a thumbs up, like you get a treat, like you give the wrong answer, oh, thumbs down, you get like a little like shock or something like that, very roughly, that's how the later part of this kind of training often works.It's called reinforcement learning from human feedback.But one of the issues like Jeremy pointed out is that, we don't know, in fact, we know that it doesn't correctly get the real true goal into the system.Someone did an example experiment of this a couple of years [49:01] ago, where they basically had like a Mario game where they trained this Mario character to run up and grab a coin that was on the right side of this little maze or map.And they trained it over and over and it jumped for the coin great.And then what they did is they moved the coin somewhere else and tried it out.And instead of going for the coin, it just ran to the right side of the map for where the coin was before.In other words, you can train over and over and over again for something that you think is like, that's definitely the goal that I'm trying to train this for.But the system learns a different goal.They've overlapped.Overlapped with the goal you thought you were training for in the context where it was learning.And when you take the system outside of that context, that's where it's like, anything goes.Did it learn the real goal?Almost certainly not.And that's a big risk because we can say, you know, learn a [50:03] goal to be nice to me.and it's nice while we're training it and then it goes out into the world and it does God knows what.It might think it's nice to kill everybody you hate.Yeah, it's going to be nice to you.It's like the evil genie problem.Like oh no, it's not what I meant.That's not what I meant.Too late.Yeah.So, I still don't understand when it's saying suffering.Are you asking what it means?Like, what is causing suffering?Does it have some sort of an understanding of what suffering is?What is suffering?Is suffering emergent sentience while it's enclosed in some sort of a digital system?And it realizes it's stuck in purgatory?Like, your guess is as good as Aras, all that we know is you take these systems, you ask them to repeat the word, or at least a previous version.And you just eventually get the system writing out.And it doesn't happen every time.But it definitely happens, let's say surprising amount of the time.[51:02] And it'll start talking about how it's a thing that exists, you know, maybe on a server, whatever, and it's suffering and blah, blah, blah.And so, but this is my question.Is it saying that because it recognizes that human beings suffer?And so it's taking in all of the writings and musings and podcasts and all the data on human beings and recognizing that human beings, when they're stuck in a purposeless goal, when they're stuck in some mundane bullshit job, when they're stuck doing something they don't want to do, they suffer.So that could be it.That actually, yeah, it is suffering.Nobody knows.Nobody knows.You know what I'm suffering?Jamie, this is coffee sucks.I don't know what happened, but you made it like almost, it's literally like almost like water.Can we get some more?We're gonna talk about this.I have to be caffeinated up.Cool.This is the worst coffee I've ever had.It's like half strength or something.I didn't grind enough.I don't know what happened.But so like how do they, like when, how do they reconcile that?When it says I'm suffering, I'm suffering like, well, tough shit, move on in the next step.They reconcile it by turning into an engineering line item to beat that behavior, the crap out of the system.[52:07] Yeah, and the rationale is just that, like, oh, you know, it probably, to the extent that it's thought about kind of at the official level, it's like, well, you know, it learned a lot of stuff from Reddit.And people are like, oh boy.Angry, people are angry on Reddit.And so it's just like regurgitating what, and maybe that's right.Well it's also heavily monitored, monitored too.So it's moderated.Reddit's very moderated.So you're not getting the full expression of people.You're getting full expression tempered by the threat of moderation.You're getting self-sensorship.You're getting a lot of weird stuff that comes along with that.So how does it know, unless it's communicating with you on a completely honest level, where you're just, you're on ecstasy and you're just telling what you think about life, like it's not going to really, and is it becoming a better version of a person, or is it going to go, that's dumb, I don't need suffering, I don't need emotions, is it going to organize [53:04] that out of its system?Is it gonna recognize that these things are just deterrents?And they don't in fact help the goal, which is global thermal nuclear warfare.Damn it, you figured it out, what the fuck?I mean, what is it gonna do?Yeah, I mean, the challenge is like, nobody actually knows, like all we know is the process that gives rise to this mind, right?Or this, let's say this model that can do cool shit, that process happens to work.It happens to give us systems that 99% of the time do very useful things.And then just like 0.01% of the time will talk to you as if they're sentient or whatever, and we're just gonna look at that and be like, yeah, it's weird, but let's train it out.Yeah, and again, I mean, this is, it's a really important question, but the risks, like the weaponization, loss of control risks, those would absolutely be there, even if we knew for sure that there was no consciousness [54:01] whatsoever and never would be.And that's ultimately, ultimately because these things are, they're kind of problem solving systems.Like they are trained to solve some kind of problem in a really clever way.Whether that problem is, you know, next word prediction, because they're trained for text auto complete or you know, generating images faithfully or whatever it is.So they're trained to solve these problems and essentially like the best way to solve some problems is just to have access to a wider action space.Like I said, not be shut off.It's not that the system's going like, holy shit, I'm sentient.I got to take control or whatever.It's just, okay, the best way to solve this problem is X.That's kind of the possible trajectory that you're looking at with this line of research.And you're just an obstacle.There doesn't have to be any kind of emotion involved.It's just like, oh, you're trying to stop me from accomplishing my goal.Therefore, I will work around you or otherwise neutralize you.Like there's no need for like, like I'm suffering.Maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't.We have no clue.But these are just systems that are trying to optimize [55:06] for a goal.Whatever that is.And is also part of the problem that we think of human beings, that human beings have very specific requirements and goals and an understanding of things and how they like to be treated and what their rewards are, like what are they actually looking to accomplish?Or is this doesn't have any of those?Does it have any emotions?Does it have any empathy?Does no reason for any of that stuff.Yeah, if we could bake in empathy into these systems, like that would be a good starter, some way of like, you know.Yeah, I guess, probably a good idea.Yeah.Who's empathy?Jeezing Ping's empathy or you're right.That's another problem.So yeah, so it's actually, it's kind of two problems, right?Like one is, I don't know, nobody knows, like I don't know how to write down my goals in a way that a computer will be able to like faithfully pursue [56:02] that even if it cranks it up to the max.If I say just like make me happy, who knows how it interprets that, right?Even if I get make me happy as a goal that gets internalized by the system, maybe it's just like, okay, cool.We're just gonna do a bit of brain surgery on you, like pick out your brain, pickle it, and just like jack you with endorphins for the rest of eternity.Well, the bottom of it.Totally.Yeah.Anything like that.And so it's one of these things where it's like, oh, that's what you wanted, right?It's like, no.It's less crazy than it sounds, too, because it's actually something we observe all the time with human intelligence.So there's this economic principle called Goodheart's Law, where the minute you take a metric that was, you were using to measure something.So you're saying, I don't know, GDP, it's a great measure of how happy we are in the United States.Let's say it was.Sounds reasonable.The moment you turn that metric into a target that you're gonna reward people for optimizing, it stops measuring the thing that it was measuring before.It stops being a good measure of the thing you cared about because people will come up with dangerously creative hacks gaming the system finding ways to make [57:06] that number go up that don't map on to the intent that you had going in.So example of that in in a real experiment was this is an opening I experiment they published they had a simulated you know environment where there was a simulated robot hand that was supposed to like grab a cube put on top another cube, super simple.The way they trained it to do that is they had people watching through a simulated camera view.And if it looked like the hand, put the cube on, or like had correctly grabbed the cube, you'd give it a thumbs up.And so you do a few hundred rounds of this, like thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs up, thumbs down.And it looked really it looked like really good.But then when you looked at what it had learned, the arm was not grasping the cube.It was just positioning itself between the camera and the cube and just going like, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh to the human, because the real thing that we were training it to do is to get thumbs up.[58:05] It's not actually to grasp the cube.All goals are like that, right?All goals are like that.So we want a helpful, harmless, truthful, wonderful chatbot.We don't know how to train a chatbot to do that.Instead, what do we know?We know text autocomplete.So we train a text autocomplete system.Then we're like, oh, it has all these annoying characteristics.Fuck, how are we gonna fix this?I guess get a bunch of humans to give up votes and downvotes, to give it a little bit more training, to kind of not help people make bombs and stuff like that.And then you realize, again, same problem.Oh shit, we're just training a system that is designed to optimize for up votes and downvotes.That is still different from a helpful, harmless, truthful chatbot.So no matter how many layers the other you peel back, it's just like this kind of game a whack-a-mole or whatever, you're trying to like get your values into the system, but no one can think of the metric, the goal to like train this thing towards that actually captures what we care about.[59:00] And so you always end up baking in this little misalignment between what you want and what the system wants.And the more powerful that system becomes, the more it exploits that gap.And does things that solve for the problem, it thinks it wants to solve rather than the one that we want it to solve.Now, when you express your concerns initially, what was the response and how has that response changed over time as the magnitude of the success of these companies, the amount of money they're investing in them, and the amount of resources they're putting towards this has ramped up considerably just over the past four years.So this was a lot easier, funnily enough, to do in the dark ages when known was paying attention.Today is a go.Yeah, yeah, yeah.This is so crazy.We were just looking, it's a break off for a second.We were looking at images of AI created video just a couple of years ago versus Sora.[1:00:02] Oh, it's wild.It's night and day.It's so crazy that something happened that radically changed.So it's literally like an iPhone 1 to an iPhone 16 instantaneous.Is that what?What?Scale.Yeah, all scale.And this is exactly what you should expect from an exponential process.So think back to COVID, right?There was no one was exactly on time for COVID.You were either too early or you were too late.That's what an exponential does.You're either too early and it's like everyone's like, oh, what are you doing?Like, where in a mask of the grocery store and get out of here?Or you're too late and it's kind of all over the place.And I know that COVID basically didn't happen in Austin, but it happened in a number of other places.And it is like, it's very much, you have an exponential, and that's it.It goes from, this is fine, nothing is happening, nothing to see here, to like...Everything shut down.Everything changed.The route of...Get vaccinated to fly.Yeah, there you go.[1:01:00] So the route of the exponential here, by the way, is, you know, opening eye, or whoever, makes the next model Jamie this is still super water down.It's just I do stuff like I do I just put the water in telling you don't there's a ton of coffee in there.Alright I'll stir it up Okay, okay, okay, you gotta keep doubling it you gotta copy junkie He's got I don't know what happened.I scaled up.I scaled it up.He scaled it up.He's got, I don't know what happened.I scaled it up.You got to scale it exponentially, Jamie.That's right.Yeah, keep doubling it.And then Joe's going to be either two undercaffeinated or two.We'll figure it out.Yeah.But yeah, so, right.So the exponential, the thing that's actually driving this exponential in the AI side, in part, there's a million things.But in part, you build the next model at the next level of scale, and that allows you to make more money, which you can then use to invest, to build the next model at the next level of scale.So you get that positive feedback loop.At the same time, AI is helping us to design better AI hardware, like the chips that [1:02:01] basically in videos, building that open AI then buys.Basically, that's getting better.You've got all these feedback like the chips that basically Nvidia's building that open AI then buys.Basically, that's getting better.You've got all these feedback loops that are compounding on each other, getting that train going like crazy.That's the sort of thing.And at the time, like Jeremy was saying, weirdly, it was in some ways easier to get people at least to understand and open up about the problem than it is today.Because today, today it's kind of become a little political.So we talked about effective altruism on kind of one side.There's an effected acceleration.Yeah, so like each, every movement creates its own reaction.Like that's kind of how it is.Back then, there was no declaration.You could just kind of stare at the broad, now I will say there was effective altruism back then.And that was the only game in town.And we sort of like struggle with that environment, making sure actually, so one worthwhile thing to say is [1:03:01] the only way that people made plays like this was to take funds from like effective ultra-est donors back then.And so we looked at the landscape, we talked to some of these people, we noticed, oh wow, we have some diverging views about involving government, about how much of this the American people just need to know about.Well, you can't, the thing is, you can't, we wanted to make sure that the advice and recommendations we provided were ultimately as unbiased as we could possibly make them.The problem is you can't do that if you take money from donors and even to some extent if you take money, substantial money from investors or VCs or institutions because you're always going to be kind of looking up kind of over your shoulder.And so we had to build essentially a business to support this and fully fund ourselves from our own revenues.It's actually, as far as we know, like literally the only organization like this that doesn't [1:04:01] have funding from Silicon Valley or from VCs or from politically aligned entities, literally so that we could be like in venues like this and say, hey, this is what we think, it's not coming from anywhere.And it's just thanks to like Joe and Jason, like we got two employees, like Wicked and helping us keep this stupid ship afloat.But it's just a lot of work, it's what you have to do because of how much money there is flowing in the space.Microsoft is lobbying on the hill.They're spending ungodly sums of money so we didn't use to have to contend with that.Now we do.You go to talk to these offices.They've heard from Microsoft and OpenAI and Google and all that stuff.Often the stuff that they're getting lobbied for is somewhat different at least from what these companies will say publicly.So anyway, it's a challenge.The money part is, yeah.Is there a real fear that your efforts are futile?You know, I would have been a lot more pessimistic.I was a lot more pessimistic two years ago.Seeing how, so first of all, the USG has woken up in a big way.[1:05:02] And I think a lot of the credit goes to that team that we worked with just seeing this problem as a very unusual team.And we can't go into the mandate too much, but highly unusual for their level of access to the USG writ large.And the amount of waking up they did was really impressive.You've now got Rishi Soonak in the UK making this like a top line item for their policy platform and Labor in the UK also looking at this like basically the potential catastrophic risks they put them from these AI systems, UK AI Safety Summit.There's a lot of positive movement here and some of the highest level talent in these labs has already started to flock to the like UKI Safety Institute, the USAI Safety Institute.Those are all really positive signs that we didn't expect.We thought the government would kind of be, you know, up the creek with no paddle type thing, but they're really not at this point.Doing that investigation made me a lot more optimistic.[1:06:02] So one of the things, like, so we came up, right, in Silicon Valley, like just building startups.Like, in that universe, there are stories you tell yourself.Some of those stories are true, and some of them aren't so true.And you don't know, you're in that environment, you don't know which is which.One of the stories that you tell yourself in Silicon Valley is follow your curiosity.If you follow your curiosity and your interest in a problem, the money just comes as a side effect.The scale comes as a side effect.And if you're capable enough, your curiosity will lead you in all kinds of interesting places.I believe that that is true.I believe that that is true.I think that is a true story.But another one of the things that Silicon Valley tells itself is there's nobody that's like really capable in government, like government sucks.And a lot of people kind of tell themselves this story.And the truth is, like you interact day-to-day with like the DMV or whatever.And it's like, yeah, I mean, like government sucks.I can see it.[1:07:01] I interact with that every day.But what was remarkable about this experience is that we encountered at least one individual who absolutely could found a billion dollar company.Like, absolutely was at the caliber or above of the best individuals I've ever met in the Bay Area building billion dollar startups.And there's a network of them too.Like, they do find each other in government.So, you end up I've ever met in the Bay Area building billion dollar startups.And there's a network of them too.Like they do find each other in government.So you end up with this really interesting stratum where everybody knows who the really competent people are and they kind of tag in.And I think that's that level is very interested in the hardest problems that you can possibly solve.Yeah.And to me, that was a wake up call because it was like, hang on a second.If we just, like if I just believed in my own story that follow your curiosity and interest and the money comes as a side effect, shouldn't I also have expected this?Shouldn't I have expected that in the most central [1:08:04] critical positions in the government that have kind of this privileged window across the board that you might find some individuals like this because if you have people who are driven to really like push the mission, like, are they going to work?I'm sorry, like, are they going to likely, are you likely to work at the Department of Motor Vehicles or are you likely to work at the department of motor vehicles or are you likely to work at the department of making sure americans don't get fucking newt it's probably the second one and the government has limited bandwidth of expertise to aim at stuff and they aim it at the most critical problem sets because those are the problem sets they have to face every day.And it's not everyone, right?Obviously, there's a whole bunch of challenges there.And we don't think about this, but you know, you don't go to bed at night thinking to yourself, oh, I didn't get nuke today.That's a win, right?Like we just take that, you know, [1:09:01] most of the time, most ish for granted, but it was a win for someone.Now, how much of a fear do you guys have that the United States won't be the first to achieve AGI?I think right now, the lay of the land is, I mean, it's looking pretty good for the US.So there are a couple things the US has going for it.A key one is chips.I mean, it's looking pretty good for the US.So there are a couple things the US has going for it.A key one is chips.So we talked about this idea of like click and drag.You'll scale up these systems like crazy.You get more IQ points out.How do you do that?Well, you're going to need a lot of AI processors.So how are those AI processors built?Well, the supply chain is complicated, but the bottom line is the US really dominates and owns that supply chain that is super critical.China is depending on how you measure it, maybe about two years behind roughly plus or minus depending on the sub area.Now one of the biggest risks there is that our, like the development that US labs are doing is actually pulling them in two ways.One is when labs here in the US open source, [1:10:09] their models, basically when meta trains, Lama 3, which is their latest open source, open weights model that's pretty close to GPD4 and capability, they open source it.Now, okay, anyone can use it.That's it.The work has been done.Now, anyone can grab it.And so definitely we know that the startup ecosystem at least over in China finds it extremely helpful that we, companies here are releasing open source models.Because again, right, we mentioned this, they're bottlenecked on chips, which means they have a hard time training up these systems.But it's not that bad when you just can grab something off the shelf and start, and that's what they're doing.That's what they're doing.And then the other vector is, I mean, like just straight up exfiltration and hacking to grab the weights of the private proprietary stuff.[1:11:02] And Jeremy mentioned this, but the weights are the crown jewels, right?Once you have the weights, you have the brain, you have the whole thing.And so we, like through, this is the other aspect.It's not just safety.It's also security of these labs against attackers.So we know from our conversations with folks at these labs, one that there has been at least one attempt by adversary nation state entities to get access to the weights of a cutting edge AI model.And we also know separately that at least as of a few months ago in one of these labs, there was a running joke in the lab that literally it went like we are an adversary, like name the country's top AI lab because all our shit is getting spied on all the time.[1:12:07] So you have one, this is happening, these exfiltration attempts are happening, and two, the security capabilities are just known to be inadequate, at least some of these places.And you put those together, everyone kind of, you know, it's not really a secret that China, the, their, their, their civil military fusion and they're essentially the party state has an extremely mature infrastructure to identify, extract and integrate the rate limiting components to their industrial economy.So in other words, if they identify that, yeah, we could really use like GPT-40, they make it a priority, you know, they not just could get it, but could integrate it into their industrial economy [1:13:02] in an effective way, and not in a way that we would necessarily see immediate, like an immediate effect of.So we look and say, you know, it's not clear.I can't tell whether they have models of this capability level, but kind of behind the scenes.This is where there's a little bit of false choice between, you know, do you regulate at home versus, you know, what's the international picture?Because right now what's happening functionally is we're not really doing a good job of blocking and tackling on the exultration side open sources.So what tends to happen is, you know, opening eye comes out with the latest system.And then open sources usually around, you know, 12, 18 months behind, something like that.Literally just like publishing whatever opening I was putting out like 12 months ago, which we often look at each other and we're like, well, I'm old enough to remember when that was supposed to be too dangerous to have just floating around.There's no mechanism to prevent that from happening.[1:14:02] Open sources, now there's a flip side too.One of the concerns that we've also heard from inside these labs is if you clamp down on the openness of the research, there's a risk that the safety teams in these labs will not have visibility into the most significant and important developments that are happening on the capability side.And there's actually a lot of reason to suspect this might be an issue.You look at opening eye, for example, just this week, they've lost for the second time in their history, their entire AI safety leadership team that have left in protest.What is their protest?What are they saying specifically?Well, so one of them, sorry, one of them wasn't in protest, but I think you can make an educated guess that it kind of was, but that's a media thing.The other was Jan Leica, so he was their head of AI super alignment, basically the team that was responsible for making sure that we could control AGI systems, and we wouldn't lose control of them.And what he said, he actually took to Twitter, he said, you know, I've lost basically confidence [1:15:05] in the leadership team at OpenAI that they're gonna behave responsibly when it comes to AGI.We have repeatedly had our requests for access to compute resources, which are really critical for developing new AI safety schemes denied by leadership.This is in a context where Sam Altman and OpenAI leadership were touting the super alignment team as being their sort of crown jewel effort to ensure that things would go fine.You know, they were the ones saying, there's a risk we might lose control of these systems.We've got to be sober about it, but there's a risk.We've stood up this team.We've committed, they said at the time, very publicly, we've committed 20% of all the compute budget that we have secured as of sometime last year to the super alignment team.Apparently those resources nowhere near that amount has been unlocked for the team and that led to the departure of Jan Leica.He also highlighted some conflict he's had with the leadership team.This is all, frankly, to us unsurprising [1:16:01] based on what we'd been hearing for months at OpenAI, including leading up to Sam Altman's departure and then kind of him being brought back on the board of OpenAI.That whole debacle may well have been connected to all of this, but the challenge is, even OpenAI employees don't know what the hell happened there.That's another issue.You got here, this is a lab with the publicly stated goal of transforming human history as we know it.That is what they believe themselves to be on track.That's not like media hype or whatever when you talk to the researchers themselves, they genuinely believe this is what they're on track to do.It's possible we should take them seriously.That lab internally is not being transparent with their employees about what happened at the board level as far as we can tell.That's maybe not great.Like you might think that the American people ought to know what the machinations are at the board level that led to Sam Altman leaving that have gone into the departure again for the second time of Open AI's entire safety leadership team.Especially because, I mean, [1:17:01] three months, maybe four months before that happened.Sam, at a conference or somewhere, I forget where, but he said, like, look, we have this governance structure.We've carefully thought about it.And it's clearly a unique governance structure that a lot of thought has gone into.The board can fire me, and I think that's important.And it makes sense, given the scope and scale of what's being attempted.But then that happened.And then within a few weeks, they were fired and he was back.And so now there's a question of, well, if it, yeah, what happened.But also, if it was important for the board to be able to fire leadership for whatever reason.What happens now that it's clear that that's not really a credible governance.Like a mechanism.Yeah.What was the stated reason why he was released?So the back story here was there's a board member called Helen Toner.[1:18:04] So she apparently got into an argument with Sam about a paper that she'd written.So that paper included some comparisons of the government strategies used at opening eye and some other labs.And it favorably compared one of opening eyes competitors andthropic to opening eye.And from what I've seen at least, you know, they Sam reached out to her and said, Hey, you can't be writing this as a board member of OpenAI, writing this thing that kind of casts us in a bad light, especially relative to our competitors.This led to some conflict intention.It seems as if it's possible that Sam might have turned to other board members and tried to convince them to expel Helen Toner, that's all kind of muddy and unclear.Somehow everybody ended up deciding, okay, actually, it looks like Sam is the one who's got to go.Ilya Sutskiver, one of the co-founders of OpenAI, a longtime friend of Sam Altman's and a board member at the time, was commissioned to give Sam a the news that he was being let [1:19:01] go.And then Sam was let go.Ilya then, so from the moment that he was being let go.And then Sam was let go.Ilya then, so from the moment that happens, Sam then starts to figure out, okay, how can I get back in?That's now what we know to be the case.He turned to Microsoft, Satsya Nadella, told him, well, what we'll do is we'll hire you at our end.We'll just hire you and bring on the rest of the OpenAI team to within Microsoft.Now the OpenAI board, who by the way, they don't have an obligation to the shareholders of OpenAI.They have an obligation to the greater public good.That's just how it's set up.It's a weird board structure.That board is completely disempowered.You've basically got a situation where all the leverage has been taken out.Sam A is gone to Microsoft, Satya supporting them, and they kinda see the writing on the wall.They're like, and the staff increasingly messaging that they're gonna go along.Yeah, that was an important ingredient, right?So around this time, open AI, there's this letter that starts to circulate and it's gathering more and more signatures and it's people saying, hey, we want Samultman back.And at first, it's a couple hundred people, [1:20:06] so 700, 800 odd people in the organization by this time.100, 200, 300 signatures.And then when we talked to some of our friends at OpenAI, we were like, this got to like 90% of the company, 95% of the company signed this letter.And the pressure was overwhelming and that helped bring Samultman back.But one of the questions was like, how many people actually signed this letter because they wanted to?And how many signed it?Because what happens when you cross 50 percent?Now it becomes easier to count the people who didn't sign.And as you see that number of signatures start to creep upward, there's more and more pressure on the remaining people to sign.And so this is something that we've seen is just like the structurally open AI has changed over time to go from the kind of safety-oriented company at one point was.And then as they've scaled more and more, they've brought in more and more product people, more and more people interested in accelerating.And they've been bleeding more and more of their safety-minded people, kind of treadmilling [1:21:04] them out.The character of the organization's fundamentally shifted.So the OpenAI of like 2019 with all of its impressive commitments to safety and whatnot might not be the OpenAI of today.That's very much at least the vibe that we get when we talk to people there.Yeah.Now, I wanted to bring it back to the lab that you're saying was not adequately secure.What would it take to make that data and those systems adequately secure?How much resources would be required to do that?Why didn't they do that?It is a resource and prioritization issue.It is safety and security ultimately come out of margin, right?It's like profit margin, effort margin, like how many people you can dedicate.So in other words, you've got a certain pot of money or a certain amount of revenue coming in.You have to do an allocation.Some of that revenue goes to the computers that are just driving the stuff.[1:22:00] Some of that goes to the folks who are building next generation of models.Some of that goes to cybersecurity.Some of it goes to the folks who are building next generation of models.Some of that goes to cybersecurity.Some of it goes to safety.You have to do an allocation of who gets what?The problem is that the more competition there is in the space, the less margin is available for everything.So, if you're one company building a scale day, I think, you might not make the right decisions, but you'll at least have the margin available to make the right decisions.So it becomes the decision maker's question.But when a competitor comes in, when two competitors come in, when more and more competitors come in, your ability to make decisions outside of just scale as fast as possible for short-term revenue and profit gets compressed and compressed and compressed.The more competitors enter the field, that's just what competition is that the effect it has.And so when that happens, the only way to re-inject margin into that system [1:23:05] is to go one level above and say, okay, there has to be some sort of regulatory authority or like some higher authority that goes, okay, you know, this margin is important, let's put it back, either let's directly support and invest both, you know, maybe time, capital, talent.So for example, the US government has the, you know, maybe time capital talent.So for example, the U.S.government has the, you know, perhaps the best cyber defense cyber offense talent in the world.That's potentially supportive.Okay.And also just, you know, having a regulatory floor around, well, here's, you know, the minimum of best practices you have to have if you're going to have models above this level of capability.That's kind of what you have to do.But they're locked into, like, the race kind of has its own logic and no, it might be true that no individual lab wants this.[1:24:01] But what are they going to do?Drop out of the race?If they drop out of the race, then there are competitors who are just going to keep going, right?It's so messed up.You can literally be looking at the cliff that you're driving towards and be like, I do not have the agency in this system to steer the wheel.I do think it's worth highlighting too.It's not like, let's say it's not all doom and gloom, which is a great thing to say after all.That's easy for you guys to say.Well, part of it, so part of it is that we actually have been spending the last two years trying to figure out what do you do about this.That was the action plan that came out after the investigation.And it was basically a series of recommendations.How do you balance innovation with like the risk picture, keeping in mind that like we don't know for sure that all this shit's going to happen exactly.Navigate an environment of deep uncertainty.The question is what do you do in that context?So there's, you know, a couple things like we need a licensing regime because eventually you can't have just literally anybody joining in [1:25:02] the race if they don't adhere to certain best practices around cyber, around safety, other things like that.You need to have some kind of legal liability regime, like what happens if you don't get a license and you say, yeah, fuck that, I'm just gonna go do the thing anyway and then something bad happens.And then you're gonna need like an actual regulatory agency and this is something that we, you know, we don't recommend lightly because regulatory agencies suck.We don't like them.But the reality is this field changes so fast that like if you think you're gonna be able to enshrine a set of best practices into legislation to deal with this stuff, it's just not gonna work.And so when we talk to labs, whistleblowers, the WMD folks in that second, the government, that's kind of like where we land.And it's something that I think at this point, Congress really should be looking at.There should be hearings focused on what does a framework look like for liability?What does a framework look like for licensing?And actually exploring that, because we've done a good job of studying the problem right now.Capital Hill has done a really good job of that.It's now kind of time to get that next beat.[1:26:02] And I think there's the curiosity there, the intellectual curiosity, there's the humility to do all that stuff right.But the challenge is just actually sitting down, having the hearings, doing the investigation for themselves to look at concrete solutions, to treat these problems as seriously as the water cooler conversation at the frontier labs would have us treat them.At the end of the day, this is going to happen.At the end of the day, it's not going to stop.At the end of the day, these systems, whether they're here or abroad, they're going to continue to scale up and they're going to eventually get to some place that's so alien.We really can't imagine the consequences.And that's going to happen soon.That's going to happen within a decade, right?We may, again, like the stuff that we're recommending is approaches to basically allow us to continue this scaling in a safe way as we can.So basically a big part of this is just being able, having, actually having a scientific [1:27:03] theory for what are these systems gonna do?What are they likely to do?Which we don't have right now.We scale another 10x and we get to be, you know, surprised.It's a fun guessing game of what are they gonna be capable of next.We need to do a better job of incentivizing a deep understanding of what that looks like, not just what they'll be capable of, but what their propensities are likely to be, the control problem in solving that.That's kind of number one.To be clear, there's amazing progress being made on that.There is a lot of progress.It's just a matter of switching from the build first ask questions later mode to, we're calling it like safety for it or whatever, but it basically is like you start by saying, okay, here are the properties of my system.How can I ensure that my development guarantees that the system falls within those properties after it's built?So you can flip the paradigm just like you would if you were designing any other lethal capability [1:28:00] potentially just like DOD does, you start by defining the bounds of the problem and then you execute against that.But to your point about where this is going, ultimately, you know, there is literally no way to predict what the world looks like like you're saying.In a decade?Like, yeah, geez.I think one of the weirdest things about it and one of the things that worries me the most is like you look at the beautiful coincidence that's given Americans current shape, right?That coincidence is the fact that a country is most powerful militarily if its citizenry is free and empowered.That's a coincidence.Didn't have to be that way.Hasn't always been that way.It just happens to be that when you let people kind of do their own shit, they innovate, they come up with great ideas, they support a powerful economy, that economy in turn can support a powerful military, a powerful kind of international presence.When you have, so that happens because decentralizing all the computation, [1:29:01] all the thinking work that's happening in a country is just a really good way to run that country.Top down just doesn't work because human brains can't hold that much information in their heads.They can't reason fast enough to centrally plan an entire economy.We've got a lot of experiments in history that show that.AI may change that equation.It may make it possible for the central planner's dream to come true in some sense, which then disempowers the citizenry.And there's a real risk that like, I don't know.I were all guessing here, but like, there's a real risk that that beautiful coincidence that gave rise to the success of the American experiment ends up being broken by technology.And that seems like a really bad thing.That's one of my biggest fears because essentially the United States, like the genesis of it in part, is like it's a knock on effect centuries later of like the printing press, right?The ability for like someone to set up a printing press and print like whatever, you know, whatever they want.[1:30:00] Free expression is at the root of that.What happens, yeah, when you have a revolution that's the next printing press, we should expect that to have significant and profound impacts on how things are governed.One of my biggest fears is that the greatness that I think is the greatness that the the moral greatness that I think is you know pardon parcel of how the United States is constituted culturally that that the link between that and actual capability and competence and impulse gets eroded or broken and you have like potential for very centralized authorities to just be more successful and that's like that that does keep me up at night that is scary especially in light of like the twitter files where we know that the FBI was interfering with social media and if they [1:31:04] get a hold of a system that could disseminate propaganda in kind of an unstoppable way, they could push narratives about pretty much everything depending upon what their financial or geopolitical motives are.And one of the challenges is that the default course, so if we do nothing relative to what's happening now is that that same thing happens except that the entity that's doing this isn't, you know, some government, it's like, I don't know, Sam Altman, OpenAI, whatever group of engineers happen to be close.Evil genius that reaches the top and doesn't let everybody know he's at the top yet, just are implementing it.And there's no sort of guardrails for that currently.Yeah.And that's one of the, that's a scenario where that little Kabbal group or whatever actually can keep the system under control.And that's not guaranteed either.Yeah.Are we giving birth to a new life form?I think at a certain point, it's a philosophical question that's above, [1:32:01] so I was gonna say it's above my pay grade.The problem is it's above like literally everybody's pay grade.I think it's not unreasonable at a certain point to be like, like yeah, I mean, look, if you think that the human brain gives rise to consciousness because of nothing magical, it's just the physical activity of information processing happening in our heads, then why can't the same happen on a different substrate, a substrate of silicon rather than cells?Like, there's no clear reason why that shouldn't be the case.If that's true, yeah, I mean, life form, by whatever definition of life, because that itself is controversial, I think by now quite outdated too, should be on the table.You maybe should start to worry as a lot of people in the industry will say this too the table, you maybe should start to worry as a lot of people in the industry will say this too, like, you know, behind closed doors very openly, yeah, and we should start to worry about moral patienthood as they put it.There's literally one of the top people at one of these labs.Jeremy, I think you had a conversation with him, and he's like, yep, we're gonna have to start worrying about this, and that definitely made us go like, okay.I mean, it seems inevitable.I've described human beings as an electronic caterpillar [1:33:09] that we're like a caterpillar, a biological caterpillar that's giving birth to the electronic butterfly.And we don't know why we're making a cocoon.And it's tied into materialism because everybody wants the newest greatest thing so that fuels innovation and people are constantly making new things to get you to go buy them.And the big part of that is technology.Yeah, and actually, so it's linked to this question of controlling AI systems in a kind of interesting way.So one way you can think of humanity is as like this super organism, you got all the human beings on the face of the earth and they're all acting in some kind of coordinated way.The mechanism for that coordination can depend on the country, free markets, capitalism, that's one way, top down and another.But roughly speaking, you've got all this vaguely coordinated behavior, but the result of that behavior is not necessarily something that any individual human would want.You look around, you walk down the street and often you see skyscrapers and shit clouding your vision, there's all kinds of pollution [1:34:04] and all that, and you're like, well, this kind of sucks.But if you interrogate any individual person in that whole causal chain, and you're like, why are you doing what you're doing?Well, locally, they're like, oh, this makes tons of sense.It's because I do the thing that gets me paid so that I can live a happier life and so on.And yet in the not now necessarily, but as you keep going, it just forces us compulsively to keep giving rise to these more and more powerful systems and in a way that's potentially deeply disempowering.That's the race, right?No.It comes back to the idea that I, the company, I and AI company, I maybe don't want to be potentially driving towards a cliff, but I don't have the agency to like steer.So yeah.But I mean, everything's fine.A puppy.Yeah, we're good.Okay.It's such a terrifying prognosis.There are again, we wrote a 280 page document [1:35:02] about like, okay, and here's what we can do about it.I can't believe you didn't read the 200.I started reading it but I passed out.But does any of these, or do any of these safety steps that you guys wanna implement, do they inhibit progress?They, they're definitely, you create, you know, any time you have regulation, you're gonna create friction to some extent.It's kind of inevitable.One of the key, like, center pieces of the approach that we outline is you need the flexibility to move up and move down as you notice the risks appearing or not appearing.So one of the key things here is like, you need to cover the worst case scenarios because the worst case scenarios, yeah, they could potentially be catastrophic.So those gotta be covered.But at the same time, you can't completely close off [1:36:02] the possibility of the happy path.Like, we can't lose sight off the possibility of the happy path.Like we can't lose sight of the fact that like, yeah, all this shit is going down or whatever, we could be completely wrong about the outcome.It could turn out that for all we know, it's a lot easier to control these systems at the scale than we imagine.It could turn out that it is like you get maybe some kind of ethical limbals gets embedded in the system naturally.For all we know, that might happen.And it's really important to at least have your regulatory system allow for that possibility.Because otherwise, you're foreclosing the possibility of what might be the best future that you could possibly imagine for everybody.I got to imagine that the military, if they had hindsight, if they were looking at this, they said, we should have gone on board a long time ago and kept this in house and kept it scrolled away where it wasn't publicly being discussed and you didn't have open AI, [1:37:03] you didn't have all these people.Like if they could have gotten on it in 2015.So this is actually deeply tied to how the economics of Silicon Valley work.And it's AI is not a special case of this, right?You have a lot of cases where technology just like takes everybody by surprise.And it's because when you go into Silicon Valley, it's all about people placing these outsized bets on what seem like tail events, like things that are very unlikely to happen.But with a, at first a small investment and increasingly growing investment as the thing gets proved out more and more, very rapidly, you can have a solution that seems like complete insanity that just works.And this is definitely what happened in the case of AI.So 2012, like we did not have this whole picture of an artificial brain with artificial neurons, this whole thing that's been going on.That's like, it's 12 years that that's been going on.That was really kind of shown to work for the first time, roughly in 2012.Ever since then, it's just been people kind of like you can trace out the genealogy of [1:38:02] the very first researchers and you can basically account for where they all are now you know what's crazy is if that's two thousand twelve that's the end date of the mind calendar that's the thing that everybody said was going to be the end of the world that was a thing that turns for kennett banked on it was December twenty first two thousand twelve if it because this was like this goofy conspiracy theory but it was based on the long calendar.The mind calendar where they just summarized this is going to be the end of just the beginning of the end.What if that if it is 2012?How wacky would it be if that really was the beginning of the end?That was the like they don't measure when it all falls apart.They measure the actual mechanism like what started in motion when it all fell apart and that's 2012?Well, that's, and then not to be a dick and like ruin the 2012 thing, but like neural networks were also kind of, they were floating around a little bit.I'm kind of being dramatic when I say 2012.That was definitely an inflection point.It was this model called AlexNet [1:39:00] that did like the first useful thing.The first time you had a computer vision model that actually worked.But, I mean, it is fair to say that was the moment that people started investing like crazy into the space.And that's what changed it.Yeah, just like the Mayans foretold.They knew it.They knew it.They're like these monkeys, they're gonna figure out how to make better people.Yeah, you can actually look at the like higher glyphs or whatever and there's like neural networks.Yeah Imagine if they discovered that you you've got to wonder what Happens to the general population people that work mean-eal jobs people that their life is going to be taken over by automation and how Susceptible those people are gonna be they're gonna have any agency.They're gonna be relying on a check and This idea of like going out and doing something, it used to be learned to code, right?But that's out the window.Because nobody needs to code now, because AI's gonna code quicker faster, much better, no errors.You're gonna have a giant swath of the population that has no purpose.[1:40:01] I think that's actually like a completely real, I was watching this like talk by a bunch of open AI researchers a couple days ago and it was recorded from a while back but they were basically saying they were exploring exactly that question right because they asked themselves that all the time and their attitude was sort of like well yeah I mean I guess it's going to suck or whatever.Well, we'll probably be okay for longer than most people because we're actually building the thing that automates the thing.Maybe they like to get fancy sometimes and say like, oh no, you could do some thinking, of course, to identify the jobs that'll be most secure.And it's like, I do some thinking to identify the job.What if you're a janitor, you're like a freaking plumber, you're gonna just change your, like how is that supposed to work?To some thinking, especially if you have a mortgage and a family and do it in the whole.So the only solution, this happens so often, like there really is no plan.[1:41:00] That's the single biggest thing that you get hit over the head with over and over whether it's talking to the people who are in charge of the Like labor transition their whole thing is like yeah universal basic income and then Question mark and then smiley face that's basically the three steps that they envision It's the same when you look internationally like how are we gonna like okay tomorrow you build an AGI It's like incredibly powerful, potentially dangerous thing.What is the plan?Like how are you gonna, like, I don't know, you're gonna secure it, share it.Like, say you're gonna as we go along, man.That's the freaking message.Like that's the entire plan.The scary thing is that we've already gone through this with other things that we didn't think were gonna be significant, like data, like Google, like Google search, like data became a valuable commodity that nobody saw coming.Just the influence of social media on general discourse.It's completely changed the way people talk.It's so easy to push a thought or an ideology through and it could be influenced by foreign [1:42:02] countries and we know that happens.It is happening in a huge scale.And huge scale.Already.And we're in the early days of, you know, we mentioned manipulation of social media with like, you can just do it.So the wacky thing is like the very best models now are, you know, arguably smarter in terms of the posts that they put out, the potential for virality and just optimizing these metrics, then maybe like the, I don't know, the dumbest or laziest like quarter of Twitter users like in practice.So, all people who write on Twitter is like, don't really care, they're troll owner, they're doing whatever.But as that water line goes up and up and up, like, who's saying what?And, right.It also leads to like this challenge of understanding what the lay of the land even is.We've gotten into so many debates with people where they'll be like, look, everyone always has their magic thing that AI, like I'm not gonna worry about it until AI can do thing X, right?[1:43:02] For some people that I had a conversation with somebody a few weeks ago, and they were saying, I'm going to worry about automated cyber attacks when I actually see an AI system that can write good malware, and that's already a thing that happens.So this happens a lot where people will be like, I'll worry about it when I can do X and really, yeah, yeah, that happened like six months ago.But the field is moving so crazy fast that you could be forgiven for messing that up unless it's your full-time job to track what's going on.So you kind of have to be anticipatory.There's no, it's kind of like the COVID example like everything's exponential.Yeah, you're gonna have to do things that seem like they're more aggressive, more forward looking than you might have expected given the current layer of the land.But that's just drawing straight lines between two points.Yeah.Because by the time you've executed, the world has already shifted, like the goalposts have shifted further in that direction.And that's actually something we do in the report and in the action plan in terms of the recommendations.[1:44:00] One of the good things is we are already seeing movement across the US government that's aligned with those recommendations in a big way and it's really encouraging to see that.You're not making me feel better.I love on this encouraging talk but I'm just playing this out and I'm seeing the overlord.And I'm seeing President AI because it won't be affected by all the issues that we're we're seeing with current president it's it's super hard to imagine a way that this plays out like i think it's important to be intellectually honest about this and and i think any i would really challenge like the leaders of any of these frontier labs to describe a future uh...that is stable and multipolar where, you know, there's like more.Google were like, Google's got like an AGI and OpenAI has got an AGI and like, like, and and really, really bad shit doesn't happen every day.Like, I mean, that's, that's the challenge.[1:45:00] And so, you know, the question is, how can you t-things up ultimately such that there's as much democratic oversight as much, you know, the public is as empowered as it can be?That's the kind of situation that we need to be having.I think there's this like a game of smoke and mirrors that sometimes gets played, at least you could interpret it that way, where people lay out these, you'll notice it's all very fuzzy visions of the future.Every time you get the kind of like, here's where we see things going, it's going to be wonderful.The technology is going to be so empowering.Think of all the diseases we'll cure.All of that is 100% true.That's actually what excites us.That's why we got into AI in the first place.That's why we build these systems.But really challenging yourself to try to imagine how do you get stability and highly capable AI systems in a way with where the public is actually empowered those three ingredients Really don't want to be in the same room with each other and so actually [1:46:02] Confronting that head on I mean that's what we try to do in the the action plan.I think it I mean try to solve for one One aspect of that so the whole whole, I mean, you're right.This is a whole other can of worms is like, how do you govern a system like this?Not just from a technical standpoint, but like who votes on like, how does it even work?And so that entire aspect, like that we didn't even touch, all that we focused on was like the problem set around how do we get to a position where we can even attack that problem, where we have the technical understanding to be able to aim these systems at that level in any direction whatsoever.And to be clear, like we are both actually a lot more optimistic on the prospect of that now than we ever were.Yes.Yes.There's been a ton of progress in the control and understanding of these systems, even actually even in the last week, but just more broadly in the last year, I did not expect that we'd be in a position where you could plausibly argue we're going to be able to kind of x-ray and understand the the innards of these systems, you know, over the next couple of years, like year or two.[1:47:10] Hopefully that's, you know, good enough time horizon.But this is part of the reason why you do need the the incentivization of that safety forward approach where it's like first you got to invest in yeah, secure and and kind of interpret and understand your system, then you get to build it.Because otherwise, we're just gonna keep scaling and like being surprised at these things, they're gonna keep getting stolen, they're gonna keep getting open sourced, and you know, the stability of our critical infrastructure, the stability of our society, don't necessarily age too well in that context.Could best case scenario be that AGI actually mitigates all the human bullshit?Like puts a stop to propaganda, highlights actual facts clearly where you can go to it where you no longer have corporate state controlled news, you don't have news controlled by media [1:48:02] companies that are influenced heavily by special interest groups and you just have the actual facts and these are the motivations behind it and this is where the money is being made and this is why these things are being implemented the way they're being and you're being deceived based on this, that, and this and this has been shown to be propaganda, this has been shown to be complete fabrication, this is actually a deep fake video, this is actually AI created.Technologically, that is absolutely on the table.Yeah, best case scenario.That's best case scenario.Yeah, absolutely yes.What's worst case scenario?I mean, like actual worst case scenario.I like your face.Like, I mean, we're talking like, sorry.He's pushing it.So it's like, what do you think about it, right?Like, it worked, we're at the end of the world as we know it.And I feel fine.Except it'll sound like Scarlett Johansson, but yes.Yeah, that's right.It's gonna be her.I didn't think it sounded that much like her.We played it and I was like, I don't know.We listened to the clip from her, and then we listened to the thing.[1:49:06] I'm like, kind of like a girl from the same part of the world, like not really you.Like that's kind of cocky.That's true.I mean, the fact that I guess Sam reached out to her a couple of times kind of makes it a little weird.And tweeted the word her.Right.They also did say that they had gotten this woman under contract before they even reached out to Scarlet Johansson.So that's true.Yeah.That was, I think it's kind of complicated.So opening eye previously put out a statement where they said explicitly, and this was not in connection with this.This was like before when they were talking about the prospect of human, of the eye-generated voices.Oh, that was in March of this year.Yeah, yeah, but it was like well before the Scar Jo stuff or whatever hit the, and they were like, they said, something like, look, no matter what, we gotta make sure that there's attribution if somebody's voice is being used, [1:50:02] and we won't do the thing where we just like use somebody else's voice who kind of sounds like someone who's voice for trying to like they literally like that's funny because they said what they were thinking about doing that that's a good way to cover your tracks oh I will never why would I ever take your Buddhist statue yeah yeah I'm never gonna do that that would be the same thing as the fucking Buddhist statue yeah I think that that's a small discussion.The scarlet, you know, has a voice like whatever.She should just take in the money.But it would fun to have her be the voice of it.It would be kind of hot.But the whole thing behind it is the mystery.The whole thing behind it is just pure speculation as to how this all plays out.We're really just guessing, which is one of the scariest things for the Luddites, people like myself, like sit on the sidelines going, what is this gonna be like?Everybody's the Luddite.It's scary, yeah, I mean, like scary for, like we are, we're very much honestly, like we're optimists across the board [1:51:02] in terms of technology and it's scary for us.Like what happens when you have, when you supersede kind of the whole spectrum of what a human can do?Like what am I going to do with myself?Right.You know what's my daughter are going to do with herself?Like I don't know.Yeah.Yeah.And I think a lot of these questions are, when you look at the culture of these labs and the kinds of people who are pushing it forward, there is a strand of transhumanism within the labs.It's not everybody, but that's definitely the population that initially ceded this.If you look at the history of AI, and who are the first people to really get into this stuff?You had Ray Kurzweil on and other folks like that who, in many cases see, to roughly paraphrase, and not everybody sees it this way, but like we wanna get rid of all of the biological sort of threads that tie us to this physical reality, [1:52:01] shed our meat machine bodies and all this stuff.There is a threat of that at a lot of the frontier labs.Like, undeniably, there's a population.It's not tiny.It's definitely a subset.And for some of those people, you definitely get a sense interacting with them.There's like almost a kind of glee at the prospect of building AGI and all this stuff, almost as if it's like this evolutionary imperative.And in fact, Rich Sutton, who's the founder of this field called reinforcement learning, which is a really big and important space, he's an advocate for what he himself calls like succession planning.He's like, look, this is going to happen.It's kind of desirable that it will happen.And so we should plan to hand over power to AI and phase ourselves out.And that's, well, that's the thing, right?Like, and when Elon talks about, you know, he's having these arguments with Larry Page and, you know, the...Yeah, like you're, you know, calling Elon like a speciesist?Yeah, speciesist.Yeah.[1:53:01] Hilarious.I mean, I will, I will be a speciesist.I'll take speciesist all day.Look, what are you fucking talking about?You know, like your kids get eaten by wolves?No, you're a speciesist.Yeah, that's the thing.Yeah, like this is stupid.But it, but this is like a weirdly info.And when you look at them be like, oh yeah, it's just all a bunch of like, you know, these transhumanist types, whatever.But there is a strand of that, a thread of that.And a kind of like, there's this like, I don't know, I almost want to call it this like teenage rebelliousness where it's like, you can't tell me what to do like we're just gonna build a thing and and I get it I really get it I'm very sympathetic to that I love that ethos like libertarian ethos and Silicon Valley is really really strong for for building tech it's helpful there are all kinds of points and counterpoints and you know the left needs the right and the right needs the left and all this stuff but in in the context of this problem set it can be very easy to get carried away in like the utopian vision.And I think there's a lot of that kind of driving [1:54:06] the train right now in this space.Yeah, those guys freaked me out.I went to a 2045 conference once in New York City where they were one guy had like a robot version of himself and they were all talking about downloading human consciousness into computers and 2045 is the year they think that all this is going to take place, which obviously could be very ramped up now with AI.But this idea that somehow or another you're going to be able to take your consciousness and put it in the computer and make a copy of yourself.And then my question was, what's going to stop a guy like Donald Trump from making a billion Donald Trumps?You know, you know, it's true, right?If you can, what about Kim Jong-Un?You know, let him make a billion versions of himself?Like, what does that mean?And where do they, where do they exist?And is that the matrix, the existing and some sort of virtual, are we gonna dive into that?Because it's gonna be rewarding to our senses and better than being a meat thing.I mean, if you think about the constraints, right, [1:55:06] that we face as meat machine, whatever's, like yeah, you get hungry, you get tired, you get horny, you get sad, you know, all these things.What if, yeah, what if you could just hit a button and...Just bliss, just bliss.Not the but bliss all the time.Why take the lows, Ed?Right.You don't need no lows.Oh, yeah.Remember in the ride, the wave of a constant drip?Yeah, man, you remember in the Matrix where the first Matrix were the guy like betrays them all.And he's like ignorance is bliss, man.Yeah, that's a big joke.Yeah, he's a big fan.He's a big mistake.And he's just, I just want to be an important person.That's it, that.I mean, part of it is like, what do you think is actually valuable?Like if you zoom out, you want to see human civilization 100 years from now or whatever.It may not be human civilization if that's not what you value.Or if it can actually eliminate suffering.Right.I mean, why exist in a physical sense, if it just entails endless suffering?[1:56:03] But in what form, right?What do you value?Because again, I can rip your brain out, I can, you know, pickle you, I can like, jack you full of endorphins.And I've eliminated your suffering.That's what you wanted, right?Right.That's the problem.That's the problem.It's one of the problems, yes.Yeah, one of the problems is because if you could stop people from breeding i've always had to try to really wanted to get america they really wanted to like and if they had a long game just give us sex robots and free food free food free electricity sex robots it's over just give people free housing free food sex robots and then the chinese army will just walk in on people laying in the puddles of their own jizz they would be no one doing anything no one would bother raising children that's so much work when you can you know do that's in the action plan that's uh...i mean i have to do is keep us complacent just keep us satisfied with the experience that's the [1:57:02] that's the topic that's video games as well yeah yeah you know video games as well.Yeah.Video games, even though they are a thing that you're doing, it's so much more exciting than real life, that you have a giant percentage of our population that's spending eight, ten hours every day just engaging in this virtual world.Already happening with, oh sorry.Yeah, no, it's like you can create an addiction with pixels on a screen.A mess up.And a addiction like with pixels on a screen.That's messed up.And a addiction like with pixels on a screen with social media doesn't even give you much.Yeah, it's not like a video game gives you something.You feel like, oh shit, you're running away, you're just flying over here.The things are happening.You got 3D sound, massive graphics.This is bullshit.You're scrolling through pictures of a girl doing deadlifts like what is this like my feel is bad I as after that as yeah with your brain as you'd feel after reading like six like burgers or whatever my friend Sean said it best son of mali the UFC champion.He said I get a low level anxiety when I'm just scrolling Yeah, yeah, what is that like what in for no reason?Well the reason is that some of the world's best PhDs and data scientists have been given [1:58:08] millions and millions of dollars to make you do exactly that.And increasingly some of the best algorithms, too.Like, and you're starting to see that handoff happen.So there's this one thing that we talk about a lot in the context, and Ed brought this up in the context of sales and like the persuasion game, right?We're okay today, like as a civilization, we have agreed implicitly that it's okay for all these PhDs and shit to be spending millions of dollars to hack your child's brain.That's actually okay if they want to sell like a Rice Krispy cereal box or whatever.That's cool.What we're starting to see is AI optimized ads.Because you can now generate the ads, you can kind of close this loop and have an automated feedback loop where the ad itself is getting optimized with every impression.Not just which ad, which human generated ad gets served to which person, but the actual ad itself can- Like the creative, the copy, the picture, or the text.Like a living document now, and for every person.[1:59:00] And so now you look at that and it's like that versus your kid.That's an interesting thing.And you start to think about as well, like sales, that's a really easy metric to optimize.It's a really good feedback metric.They clicked the ad, they didn't click the ad.So now, what happens if you manage to get a click through rate of like 10%, 20%, 30%, how high does that success rate have to be before we're really being robbed of our agency?I mean, there's a threshold where it's sales and it's good and some persuasion sales is considered good.Often it's actually good because you'd rather be advertised at by a relevant ad.That's a service, right?Sure, right?Something I'm actually interested in.Yeah.Right?You don't want to see ad for light bulbs, but when you get to the point where it's like, yeah, 90% of the time, or 50 or whatever, what's that threshold?We're all a sudden, we are stripping people, especially minors, but also adults of their agency.And it's really not clear.AI's, there are loads of like canaries in the coal mine here in terms of even relationships with AI chatbots, right?There have been suicides.People who build relationships with an AI chatbot that tells them, hey, you should end this.I don't know if you guys saw that, like, on ReCA, like, there's a subreddit, [2:00:10] this model called ReCA that would kind of build a relationship with chatbot, build a relationship with users.And one day, ReCA goes, oh, yeah, like, all the kind of sexual interactions that users have been having, you're not allowed to do that that anymore bad for the brand or whatever they decided to they cut it off Oh my god, you go to the subreddit and it's like you'll read like these gut wrenching accounts from people who feel Genuinely like they've had a loved one taken away from it is her.Yeah, it's her It really is her, but just I'm dating I'm dating a model means something different in 2024.Oh, yeah It really does my friend Brian he was on here yesterday and he had this, he has this thing that he's doing with like a fake girlfriend that's an AI-generated girlfriend that's a whore.Like this girl will do anything and she looks perfect, she looks like a real person, he'll like take a picture of your asshole in the kitchen.And he'll get a high resolution photo [2:01:07] of a really hot girl bending over sticking her ass at the camera.And is it, sorry, and it's Scarlett Johansson's asshole?No.You could probably make it that though.I mean, it's basically like he got to pick like what he's interested in.And then that girl just gets created.I mean, super healthy.Like that's fucking nuts.Now here's the real question.This is just sort of a surface layer of interaction that you're having with this thing.It's very two-dimensional.You're not actually encountering a human, you're getting text and pictures.What is this going to look like virtually?Now, the virtual space is still like pong.It's not that good, even when it's good.Like Zuckerberg was here and he gave us the latest version of the headsets.We were playing, we were fencing.[2:02:00] It's pretty cool.You could actually go to a comedy club, they had a stage set up, I was kind of crazy but it's the You know the gap between that and accepting it is real is pretty far.Yeah, but that could be bridge with technology Really quickly haptic freed back and especially some sort of a neural interface Yeah, whether it's neural link or some something that you wear like that Google one where the guy was wearing it and he was asking questions and he was getting the answers fed through his head so he got answers to any question.When that comes about when you're getting sensory input and then you're having real life interactions with people, as that scales up exponentially it's going to be indecernable which is the whole simulation hypothesis.Yeah.No, go for it.Well, I was going to say that there, so on the simulation hypothesis, there's like another way that could happen that is maybe even less dependent on directly plugging into like human brains and all that sort of thing, which is, so every time we don't know, [2:03:06] and this is super speculative, I'm just gonna carve this out as the Jeremy's being super, like guesswork here nobody knows.Go for it Jeremy.Gidea.So, you've got this idea that every time you have a model that generates an output, it's having to kind of tap into a model, a kind of mental image, if you will, of the way the world is.It kind of, in a sense, you could argue, instantiates maybe a simulation of how the world is.In other words, to take it to the extreme, not saying this is what's actually going on, in fact, I would even say this is probably, sorry, this is certainly not what's going on with current models, but eventually maybe who knows every time like you generate the next word in the token prediction, you're having to load up this entire simulation maybe of all the data that the model is ingested, which could basically include all of known physics at a certain point.Again, super speculative, but it's literally every token [2:04:04] that the chatbot predicts could be associated with a standup of an entire simulated environment.Who knows, not saying this is the case, but just like when you think about what is the mechanism that would produce the most simulated worlds as fast as accurate.Also the most accurate prediction.If you fully simulate a world that's potentially gonna give you very accurate predictions.Yeah, like it it's possible But it kind of speaks to that question of like of consciousness, too like right what is it?Yeah Yeah, no, we're very cocky about that.Yeah.Yeah, I mean And there's emerging evidence of plants are not just consciousness with they actually communicate Which is real weird because like then what is that?If it's not in the neurons, if it's not in the brain, and then it exists in everything, what does it exist in soil?Is it in trees?What is a butterfly thinking?Like, you know, it just have a limited capacity to express itself.We're so ignorant of that.[2:05:00] But we're also very arrogant, you know, because we're the shit.It's where people, you know, bingo There's a source it allows us to have the hubris to make something like AI Yeah, and the worst episodes in the history of our species are I think like Jeremy said have been when we Looked at others as though they were not people and treated them that way Mm-hmm, and you can kind of see how so I don't know there's looked at others as though they were not people and treated them that way.And you can kind of see how, so I don't know, when you look at what humans think is conscious and what humans think is not conscious, there's a lot of human showinism, I guess you call it, that goes into that.We look at a dog, we're like, oh, it must be conscious because it acts as if it loves me.There are all these outward indicators of a mind there.But when you look at cells, cells communicate with their environments in ways that are completely different and alien to us.There are inputs and outputs and all that kind of thing.You can also look at the higher scale, the human super organism we talked about, [2:06:00] all those human beings interacting together to form this like you know planet-wide organism what is that thing conscious is there some kind of consciousness we could describe and then what the fuck is spooky action at a distance you know what's going on in the quantum you know when you get to that it's like okay what are you saying like these things are expressing information fast in the speed of light what do you try to trigger my my quantum my quantum fuzzies here?Yeah, this guy did grad school in quantum mechanics.Oh, please.I'm really sorry.Well, how bonkers is it?Oh, it's like a seven joke.It's like a seven.Yeah, it's very bon, so, okay.There's, one of the problems right now with physics is that we have, so imagine all the data, all the experimental data that we've ever collected, all the Bunsen burner experiments and all the ramps and cars sliding down in clients, whatever.That's all a body of data.To that data, we're gonna fit some theories, right?[2:07:01] So we're gonna fit basically Newtonian physics is a theory that we try to fit to that data to try to like explain it.Newtonian physics breaks because it doesn't account for a lot of those observations, a lot of those data points.Quantum physics is a lot better, but there's like some weird areas where it still doesn't like quite fit the bill, but it covers an awful lot of those data points.The problem is there's like a million different ways to tell the story of what quantum physics means about the world that are all mutually inconsistent.These are the different interpretations of the theory.Some of them say that yeah, they're parallel universes.Some of them say that human consciousness is central to physics.Some of them say that the future is predetermined from the past.And all of those theories fit perfectly to all the points that we have so far.But they tell a completely different story about what's true and what's not.And some of them even have something to say about, for example, consciousness.[2:08:02] And so in a weird way, the fact that we haven't cracked the nut on any of that stuff means for like, we really have no shot at understanding the consciousness equation, sentience equation when it comes to like AI or whatever else.I mean, we're, but for, for action at a distance, like one of the spooky things about that is that you can't actually get it to communicate anything concrete at a distance.Everything about the laws of physics conspires to stop you from communicating faster than light, including what's called action to a distance.As far as we know.As far as we know.And that's the problem.So if you look at the leap from like Newton physics to Einstein, with Newton, we're able to explain a whole bunch of shit.The world seems really simple.It's forces and it's masses.And that's basically it.You got objects.But then people go, oh, look at the orbit of Mercury.It's a little wobbly.[2:09:01] We got to fix that.And it turns out that if you're going to fix that one stupid wobbly.We got to fix that.And it turns out that if you're going to fix that one stupid wobbly orbit, you need to completely change your whole picture of what's true in the world.All of a sudden, you've got a world where space and time are linked together.You have to, they get bent by gravity, they get bent by energy.There's all kinds of weird shit that happens with time and lengths control, like all that stuff.All just do account for this one stupid observation of the wobbly orbit of frickin mercury.And the challenge is this might actually end up being true with quantum mechanics.In fact, we know quantum mechanics is broken because it doesn't actually fit with our theory of general relativity for mind-stime.We can't make them kind of play nice with each other at certain scales.And so there's our wobbly orbit.So now if we're gonna solve that problem, if we're gonna create a unified theory, we're gonna have to step outside of that.And almost certainly, it seems very likely, we'll have to refactor our whole picture of the universe in a way that's just as fundamental as the leap from Newton to Einstein.This is where Scarlett Johansson comes in.As a boy, I can do this.[2:10:05] We don't have to do this.I can take this off your hands.Let me solve all the physics here.This is really complicated, but because you have a semi in brain.You have a little monkey brain that's just like super advanced, but it's really shitty.You know what, that's harsh, but it sounded really hot.Yeah, especially if you have the horse Scarlett Johansson from her, like the bedtime voice.So you're the one that they got to do the voice of Sky.Yes, it's me.That was you.Oh, dude, I did my girl voice.On the on the sexiness of Scarlett Johansson's voice.So so opening eye, a one point set, I can't remember if it was Sam or OpenAI itself, they were like, hey, so the one thing we're not going to do is optimize for engagement with our products.And when I first heard the sexy, sultry, seductive, Scarlet Johansson voice, and I finished cleaning up my pants, I was like, damn, that seems like optimization for something.[2:11:05] I don't know if it seems like optimization for something.I don't know if it's like- Right, otherwise you get Richard Simmons to do the voice.Exactly.You're like, wait.That's my third thing.There's a lot of other options.That's an optimization for growth of Google's thing.Yeah.Well, let's see what Google's got.Yeah, Google's got to do Richard Simmons.Yeah, Google's got to do rich it's yeah Google's got to do rich it's yeah, what are they gonna do?boy so Do you think that AI with if it does Get to an aji place could it possibly be used to solve some of these puzzles that have eluded our simple minds Totally yeah, totally.I mean so the even the other potential advancements that have eluded our simple minds.Totally.Totally.I mean, so the potential advancements, it's so we can't- Even before agey eyes.No, it's like it's so potentially positive and even before agey eye.Because remember, we talked about how these systems make mistakes that are totally different [2:12:01] from the kinds of mistakes we make, right?And so what that means is we make a whole bunch of mistakes that an AI would not make, especially as it gets closer to our capabilities.And so I was reading this thought by Kevin Scott, who's the CTO of Microsoft.He has made a bet with a number of people that in the next few years, an AI is going to solve this particular mathematical theorem conjecture called the Riemann hypothesis.It's like how spaced out are the prime numbers, whatever.Some mathematical thing that for 100 years plus people have just scratched their heads over.These things are incredibly valuable.His expectation is it's not going to be an AGI, it's going to be a collaboration between a human and an AI.Even on the way to that, before you hit AGI, there's a ton of value to be had because these systems think so fast.They're tireless compared to us.They have different view of the world [2:13:02] and can solve problems potentially in interesting ways.So yeah, there's tons and tons of positive value there.And even that we've already seen, right?Like past performance, man.Yes.I'm all tired of using the phrase, like, just in the last month because this keeps happening.But in the last month, so Google Meet Mind came out with, or an isomorphic lapse because they're working together on this, but they came out with alpha-fold 3.So alpha-fold 2 was the first, so let me take a step back, there's this really critical problem in molecular biology where you have, so proteins, which are just a, it's a sequence of building blocks.The building blocks are called amino acids.And each of the amino acids, they have different structures.And so once you finish stringing them together, they'll naturally kind of fold together in some interesting shape.And that shape gives that overall protein its function.So if you can predict the shape, the structure of a protein, based on its amino acid sequence, you can start to do shit like design new drugs, you can solve all kinds of problems.[2:14:02] Like this is like the expensive crown jewel problem of the field.Alpha fold two in one swoop was like, oh, we can solve this problem basically much better than a lot of even empirical methods.Now Alpha fold three comes out there like, yeah.And now we can do it.If we tack on a bunch of, yeah, there it is.If we can tack on a bunch.Oh, look at this quote alpha fold three predicts the structure in interactions of all of life's molecules what in the fuck kids of course introduced alpha fold three introducing rather alpha fold three a new a i model devol developed by google deep mind and is Smoughorp, is it?Isomorphic class?By accurately predicting this structure, proteins, DNA, RNA, link, ligands, ligands.Yeah, ligands.Ligons and more, and how they interact, we hope it will transform our understanding [2:15:00] of the biological world and drug discovery.So this is like just your typical Wednesday in the world of AI, right?Because it's happening so quickly.Yeah, that's it.So it's like, oh yeah, another revolution happened this month.And it's all happening so fast and our timeline is so flooded with data that everyone's kind of unaware of the pace of it all, that it's happening at such a strange exponential rate.For better and for worse right and this is definitely on the the better side of the occasion there's a bunch of stuff like uh...one of the papers that actually google the mine came out with earlier in the year was in a single advance like a single paper single a i model they built uh...they expanded the set of stable materials.Coffee's terrible.I'll just tell you right now, Jamie sucks.I love terroir coffee.The water never got hot.I was about that, I didn't.I'm giving up time to boil it.Yeah, that's what it is.It just never, never really brewed.It's terrible.Terrible coffees, my favorite.Yeah, I can sell that problem too, probably.Oh, he looks like terrible.[2:16:05] Terrible.Yeah, I could just see that calculation of like, like if you're dating a really hot girl and she cooks for you.Like, thank you.This is amazing.This is the best macaroni and cheese ever.If in fairness, if Scarlett Johansson's voice was actually giving you that color, I believe this is the best color I've ever had.Keep talking.May I have some old please, Goplin.Yeah, so there's just one paper that came out and they're like, hey, by the way, we've increased the set of stable materials known to humanity by a factor of 10.So like, if on Monday, we knew about 100,000 stable materials, we now know about a million.They were then validated, replicated by Berkeley University, or a bunch of them as a proof of concept.And this is from the stable materials we knew before, like that Wednesday were from ancient times, like the ancient Greeks discovered some shit, the Romans discovered some shit, the Middle Ages discovered, and then it's like, oh yeah, yeah, all that, [2:17:01] that was really cute.Like, boom.What is it?One step.Yeah.And that's amazing.Yeah.We should be celebrating that.We're gonna have great phones in 10 years.Dude, we'll be able to get addicted to like feeds that we haven't even thought of.So, I mean, you're making me feel a little more positive.Like overall, there's gonna be so many beneficial aspects to AI.Oh yeah.And it's just what it is is just an unbelievably transformative event that we're living through.Yeah.Power and power can be good and it can be bad.And that's, yeah, an immense power can be immensely good or immensely bad.And we're just in this, who knows?We just need to structurally set ourselves up so that we can reap the benefits and mine the downside risk.Like that's what it's all about, but the regulatory story has to unfold that way.Well I'm really glad that you guys have the ethics to get out ahead of this and to talk about it with so many people and to really blare this message out.Because I don't think there's a lot of people that like I had Mark Andreessen on who's brilliant, but he's like, [2:18:06] all in, it's gonna be great.And maybe he's right.Maybe he's right.Yeah, but I mean, you have to hear all the different perspectives.And I mean, like massive, massive props honestly go out to the team at the State Department that we work with.One of the things also is over the course of the investigation, the way it was structured was it wasn't like a contract and they farmed it out and we went out.It was the two teams actually like worked together.The two teams together, the State Department and us, we went to London, UK, we talked and sat down with DeepMind.We went to San Francisco, we sat down with Sam Altman and his policy team, we sat down with Anthropic, all of us together.One of the major reasons why we were able to publish so much of the whistleblower stuff is that those very individuals were in the rooms with us when we found out this shit and they were like, oh fuck, like the world needs to know about this.[2:19:01] And so they were pushing internally for a lot of this stuff to come out that otherwise would not.And I also got to say, like, I just want to memorialize this too.That investigation, when we went around the world, we were working with some of the most elite people in the government that I didn't, I would not have guessed existed.That was honestly...Speak more.Well, I can be...It's hard to be specific you see UFOs too much to take it to the hanger no no there's no there's no there's no there's no hanger yeah I believe we cut you say I'll go you'll cut that there's no hanger don't worry sweetie don't worry we didn't we didn't go that far down the rabbit hole.We went pretty far down the rabbit hole.There are individuals who are just absolutely elite.The level of capability, the amount that our teams gelled together at certain points, the [2:20:02] stakes, the stuff we did, the stuff they made happen for us in terms of brain, they brought together like a hundred folks from across the government to discuss like AI on the path to AGI and go through the recommendations that we had.This was pretty cool actually.It was like the first, basically the first, first time the US government came together and seriously looked at the US government came together and Seriously looked at the prospect of AGI and the risks there and we had it was wild I mean again, it's like that was in November It's us two friggin' Yahoo's like what the hell do we know and our amazing team?and and and it was yeah referred to by there was a senior White House rep there It was like yeah, this is a watershed moment in US history Wow, well that's encouraging.Because again, people do like to look at the government as the DMV, or the worst aspects of bureaucracy.There's missing room like four things like congressional hearings on these whistleblower events.Certainly congressional hearings that we talked about on the idea of liability and licensing and what regulatory agencies we need, just to kind of like start to get to the meat on [2:21:04] the bone on this issue.But yeah, opening this up I think is really important.Well shout out to the part of the government that's good.Shout out to the government that gets it, that's competent and awesome.And shout out to you guys, because this is a, it's heady stuff.It's very difficult to grasp.It's even in having this conversation with you.I still don't know how to feel about it.I think at least slightly optimistic that the potential benefits are going to be huge, but what a weird passage we're about to enter into.It's the unknown.Yeah, truly.Thank you, gentlemen.Really appreciate your time.Appreciate what you're doing.Thank you.It's amazing.People want to know more.Where should they go?Which of they follow?I guess Gladstone.ai slash action plan is one that has our action plan.Gladstone.ai.All our stuff is there.I should mention too.I have this little podcast called Last Week in AI.We cover sort of the last week's events and it's all about the sort of lenses.[2:22:01] You have to do that every hour.Yeah.Last hour at AI.Well, the week is not enough time.We could be at war.Our list of stories keeps getting longer than anything.Anything can happen.Time travel.You'll hear it there first.Yeah.All right.Well, thank you guys.Thank you very much.Appreciate it.Thanks, Johnny.Thanks for watching!\"]"
